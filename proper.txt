“Dead.” The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock.

“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.

“Oh no ... Sirius!” “What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione were holding half each.
Expected: 5

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1

“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster?
Expected: 7

“This is for the Daily Prophet “Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“You can use animals as Horcruxes?” “Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business.

“Loo/d” He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar.

“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 1

Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.

The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher’s desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Ginny, where ’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator’s podium.
Expected: 6

Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money.

“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily.

Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.” “Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.
Expected: 6

The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace.

Harry squinted.
Expected: 3

“You want to — to kill Black or something?” “Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice.

Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.

“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.

“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Whatever,” said Malfoy.
Expected: 2

I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up.

Maybe to give yourself extra powers?

That’s why we decided we’d better get going — ” “The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,” snarled Ron.

“What are you looking for, boy?” “Nothing,” said Harry.

Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
Expected: 1

“Just an idea, thought you might like to get together — ” “I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can’t do it in the common room now, can they, not with Hermione there.” He was talking in a very fast, feverish way.
Expected: 5

He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.
Expected: 6

Now, thestrals — ” “Hem, hem.” Professor Umbridge had arrived.
Expected: 5

“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session.
Expected: 5

But the thing that was lowering Harry’s spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys.

Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!” The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.

He loves Muggle- borns.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Well ... okay.
Expected: 6

Actual: 6

We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot — ”  But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.

It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time — And then it hit him — he understood.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

"... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.” “Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.

“Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.” Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.
Expected: 5

Expected: 7

They were going even deeper now and gathering speed.

“I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for another hour at least!” “Cho?” said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly at Harry.
Expected: 5

“She’s so full of herself.” Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for  saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five seconds?” “Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance.

Expected: 6

He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.

Expected: 6

“You’d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.”  And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual.

“And you, Malfoy — ”  Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

I forbid you to tell the boy anything!” A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.

“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.

And the family will never set Dobby free .

Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.

Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business.

Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore did not answer.

Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, “That m-must have b- been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!” Gingerly Harry took another step forward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more.
Expected: 4

But something that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous — ” “Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.

“I — I remembered those dementors.” “I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully.

He glanced sideways at Hermione, who was  gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open.

This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before.

“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration.

I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’  “Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore!

“So unless you want detention, watch your mouth!” Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor.

Professor McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table.

Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs.

It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them... “You really miss it, don’t you?” said Cho.

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.

“So you put some crackpot spell on my son so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery, or something, did you?” “How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and voice rising together.

“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up.

He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal.

No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking.

One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding toward them.

Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding- bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.

“Fudge,” said Black.

Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive.

“He’s sort of ... stopped coming to work.

“I don’t think Harry should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose — ” “Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for permission,” said Harry bitterly.

But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again; he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius.

“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Umbridge.

And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.

Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless-looking.

“All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.” Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them.

I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes ...” “And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a money spinner,” continued George enthusiastically.

“Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can’t throw it out.” “Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it — ” “I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall.

“Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?” “Yep,” said Harry.

He caught hold of Hermione ’s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself.

Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy.

They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as  Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track.

In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet- Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy,  deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.

The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist — Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt.

Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.

The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship .

“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.” Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.

“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.” “Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four?” said George.

Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard...

“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!” “Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: “Er — Phineas?

Go on, go on, try it out.” Harry tried.

The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.

“Eat,” he repeated.

“Ah, well ... you can’t evade me forever, Harry!” And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.

Where are you meeting?” “Well, that’s a bit of a problem now,” said Harry.

“Hello, Harry, dear.

His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and- black ring; he had already killed his father.

“That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.” “A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?” asked Harry.

Who opened it last time?” “Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!” squealed the elf.

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in.

Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers.

How long it would take  Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter.

“What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s us.” “But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
Expected: 2

“He must’ve known you’d always want to come back.” Ron looked grateful, but still awkward.

But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.

Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.

The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.

“Oh, no,” said Ron.

Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?” “As to that, I cannot be sure.” “Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.

“What’s been going on?” said Ron.

“Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do.

All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk  around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.
Expected: 1

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.
Expected: 1

“Let’s have a  volunteer pair — Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you — ” “A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,” said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat.

“Come on now — round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies,” Lockhart shouted.
Expected: 2

“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him.

“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.

Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions.
Expected: 1

Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think Filch would object, when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights?

There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on  platform nine and three-quarters came in.

It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.

He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
Expected: 7

“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall.

Hermione ’s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.

He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face.

A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound — except that there was no wound — “Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly.

They pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean, Seamus, and Neville were already asleep.

You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it — ” Harry cut across Ron.
Expected: 7

“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting.

They were bound to notice something.

Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as possible.

Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart’s office.

The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas.
Expected: 4

“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked.
Expected: 7

Poor Severus ...” “If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” “I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I intended, did it?” “No,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.” Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry’s shoulder, but thought better of it.
Expected: 3

I assuaged my conscience with empty words.

“Come in,” called Lupin.

Not today, though, not now ...” And taking a deep breath, she cried, “Cruc — ” “NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode.

Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most ... it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other.

“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?” “I will,” said Snape.

He stood back, then shut the door quickly.

He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.

“Definitely,” said George.

You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at you,” said Harry, reasonably.

“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re here?” “Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly.

“No idea,” he said.
Expected: 4

Ginny shrugged and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.” “Okay,” said Hermione, “well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius — ” “He’s not there, Hermione!” “I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers through it.”  Even through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Hermione ’s offer to accompany him into Umbridge’s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces.
Expected: 7

Astounded, Harry bent over it.
Expected: 3

There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.

He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard  voices.

For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by people.
Expected: 7

“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house.

Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face.

It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.

It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared.
Expected: 1

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty.

‘Tm not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley.

The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.

He felt a sickening surge of remorse.

Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the bed.
Expected: 3

He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him.
Expected: 5

Then, with a swooping feeling as  though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s study.
Expected: 5

Snape’s only one Death Eater.

Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.

“It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.” They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din.

Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry.

They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.

WE WON!” They beamed up at him as he passed; there was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron’s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down.

The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.

“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry’s eyes.

The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows.
Expected: 6

Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive.

Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog’s Head and telling them where to meet that evening.

Class dismissed.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall.
Expected: 3

It was therefore a full week later — once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together — that Hermione agreed to make the journey.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Don’t move!” He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open  and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ” Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!” Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance.
Expected: 4

“Good,” said Harry quietly, when she told him, “because we’ve found somewhere to have our first  Defense meeting.

He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch.
Expected: 6

“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold.

Without  Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas.
Expected: 7

You know he’s not really up to long journeys ... but how else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?” “Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him up.” He nodded toward Professor Lupin.
Expected: 3

“Anyway, that’s not the point,” interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes  rather than look at her.

“You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ” “And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks.

“You don’t know what I’ve done!” “Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly.

Big bones ... I’ll give her big bones.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast- Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.

Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now.

Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t think what to — but what’s wrong with Albus?” She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide- eyed, at Dumbledore.
Expected: 6

“I’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so — ” “He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing.

“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes.

“Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning.

“Daddy told me.

He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as  far as they knew, had anybody else.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.” There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
Expected: 6

He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.

“Mount your brooms ... on my whistle .

“And this is Nymphadora — ” “ Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a shudder.

Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.

“She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even here?” “I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively.
Expected: 6

Voldemort — he can fly — went straight for them.
Expected: 7

Well, that was easy, really — “Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help — ” “That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all.

I wanted glory.

“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said Hermione.

“I don’t want ... Don’t make me ...”  Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

It’s just astounding ... of all the things to stop him .
Expected: 1

There was a long silence.
Expected: 2

The smell of roast beef made Harry’s stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

You support the Tornados, right?” His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery.

“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he said.

“My name is Albus Dumbledore.

“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s cage was perched.

He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn’t had in centuries.

Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

The problem was that his legs didn’t seem to want to move.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.” “I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands.

Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!” “Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron.
Expected: 7

Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences — Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor.

“A mother kill her own daughter?

Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth roughly.

“ — and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize ... he just thinks it’s a powerful wand “Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” “But don’t you see?

Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment.

“What d’you reckon they’ll do to him?” “Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione.
Expected: 7

Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand.

Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
Expected: 7

His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.

It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.

“C’mon, let’s go.
Expected: 2

“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.” “This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning.
Expected: 2

Then I packed up Moody’s clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts.

“So what are we going to do?” “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”  Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.

Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand.

“Why don’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?” “Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, “but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served.” “Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried.

She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.

He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron’s dingy attic room.

“Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though ...” Ron frowned slightly.

The exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry’s scar.

After another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they’re over.” Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Shouldn’t be hard to find.” When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

I’ve been trying to watch the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything — ” “That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyway... And we know quite a lot.” “More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.

The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.
Expected: 7

“Sorry, I only — ” “Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize — “Ron — ” “I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m up to my neck in it here — ” “No — look!” Hermione was pointing to the nearest window.

To ten Galleons a hair!”  And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.

He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.

The Dursleys bought Dudley  and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.

The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.

The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows.

“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased.

To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing  feet from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle — Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais, Harry still staring at the archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting — But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him...

Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, “ Expelliarmus\ ” Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.

Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse.” He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop.

“Ruddy old nags though, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will be able “Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids.

“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.

Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done it — ” He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them.

They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work — ”  “Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry.

“Is that your dad down the end, Neville?” “What’s this?” said Mrs. Longbottom sharply.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

No point pretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.” Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.

As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o’clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him.

“Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry’s face.
Expected: 4

“Well, it was a bad night for romance all around.
Expected: 6

“Talk about paranoid ...” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice.
Expected: 2

“What do we have to do?” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,” said Harry sarcastically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.

Actual: 5

“I mean, everyone hates him — ” “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” Harry spun around.

He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Harry turned this news over in his mind.

Gilderoy Lockhart’s knees had given way.

And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.

An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too.

He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed.

Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle softly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.

“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.
Expected: 2

All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.

“Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle.

Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again.

Harry’s head jerked upward.

“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.

The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery.

“What’s up?” said several voices.

“I believe he used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information — ” “But Travers and Mulciber we have,” said Mr. Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook.
Expected: 1

And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one ...

Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for the book.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

If you will grasp my arm.” Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant.

“Tripe, Sibyll?” Professor Trelawney ignored her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“What’s Snape got to do with it?” “He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily.

Black and Lupin were looking at each other.

Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.
Expected: 1

For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air.

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.

Concentrating with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy ’s  doing in here.

As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an irritable Fudge.

Then his face split in a wide smile.

“Ron!” he shouted.

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Why is that?” Hermione laughed derisively.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed.

The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus ’s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much interested in anything else.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

It’s been a month, and no one’s seen hide nor hair of him, and I don’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self- spelling wands.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone —  A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

The adults seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the door opened; all of them looked around hastily and fell silent.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?” “No, I don’t think so, sir.

“It’s nothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie say.

“Only if we’re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup.

It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.

Expected: 6

“Well ... think about it,” said Hermione quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

lags ... And how are you, Ron — Hermione?” Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon door opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“I’ll just — ” He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

“Oh ... well ...” She shrugged.
Expected: 5

She shook her head in disbelief.

“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently.

“I’ll — I’ll fight you!” “Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot — ” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville.

“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at his feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

The Quidditch season had begun.

Actual: 6

“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He had no idea what to say to her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Expected: 5

The dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath.
Expected: 3

As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.

Lupin looked at him quickly.

“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge.

“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English.

“Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.” “But James Potter insisted on using Black?” “He did,” said Fudge heavily.

It was small, but bright.

“Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play.

“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron.
Expected: 3

Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Even you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!” “I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased.
Expected: 6

“ They know\” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear.

“What happened to your glasses?

“Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got to say on the subject — ” And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.
Expected: 2

Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?” Riddle stepped closer.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“And how long d’you reckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?” Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget- me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.

“Oh ... well ... yes, I suppose it is...” “How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder.
Expected: 5

“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, “RiddikulusV’ almost lazily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“What d’you reckon ’s the matter with him?” There was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

And then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

I  would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.” “And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked Bellatrix.

Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success.

The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.” “Well, come on,” said Hermione, jumping up, “we’d better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late...”  But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry’s moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner.

Nasty night.

Harry saw  Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads.

His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor.

“Is it time to go?

So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.” “Okay,” said Harry slowly.

“You’re going out again,” he said.

He gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged.

“Sirius’s knife!” said Harry, and he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall.

“Mine was pretty quiet,” said Cho.

Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.

The silent crowd parted to let them pass.

He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor.

He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.

His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening.

Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?” Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.

And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything.

One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.

“After all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t kill a little boy?

Anyway ... this writing desk ...” He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly.
Expected: 5

Quirrell was mumbling something.

“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.
Expected: 3

“No idea,” Harry bellowed back.
Expected: 7

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.

“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said.
Expected: 3

“You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge’s corridor, okay?” Harry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.

“Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions,” said Luna serenely.

The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his  cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.

“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

The only things left out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.
Expected: 7

Harry stared at them all watching him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

I thought he was a bit of an idiot,” said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible.
Expected: 2

After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.

“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too,” said Cho, drawing herself up proudly.

You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.” He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.

It was circling around him and Black and Hermione.
Expected: 3

He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Tell Mummy!” Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,” said Professor Umbridge smoothly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

They had wasted so much time — they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.

The common room emptied slowly around Harry.

“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached.

Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
Expected: 3

He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.

And there was Dirk Cresswell in  the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!” He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self- satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.

The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater.

The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.

Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

. . well ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Well, that could be arranged very easily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so  that they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

It  was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum).” The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Please,” said Hermione breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we don’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees!
Expected: 5

Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
Expected: 7

I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?” “Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore ’s eccentric appearance.

“I dare not, Headmaster!

Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry.
Expected: 1

Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George was hiccuping.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He didn’t care that Snape’s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

...” So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady.
Expected: 7

“Pity sugar makes it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

But — let me go and find the boy, my Lord.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
Expected: 6

So if I look in the mirror, I should see my self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden!

“All right ...” She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
Expected: 1

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than usual this year!” “Umbridge hates part-humans,” said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.
Expected: 1

“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.
Expected: 3

LEAVE THE BIRD!
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“I’ve just been to your office, Lupin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Very good indeed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat — ” “No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

I wish I hadn’t  left my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.” “Why do you want it?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

...” “Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?” sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P. S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

...” And pulling Dumbledore ’s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.”  Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Professor ... how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?” Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry  could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it ... not unless they really loathed them .
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Potter and his friends, caught at last!” “Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Don’t come down.
Expected: 3

I thought you made a mistake, but — ” Riddle laughed his high laugh again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“This way, Potter,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

...” Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

We can’t be together.”  She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some stupid, noble reason, isn’t it?” “It’s been like ... like something out of someone else’s life, these last few weeks with you,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

A few people looked around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

It was a stag.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

...” Harry said, even more quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge will wait for proof?” said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories, banging the door behind her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

And people think he’s Slytherin’s heir!” Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him — but then — “I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling...
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“YES!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was gone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“What about Luna?” “Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive — ” began Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

The Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.” Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway.
Expected: 7

“You’re late.” “Sorry,” said Harry nervously.
Expected: 5

When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Expected: 1

“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself.
Expected: 7

Harry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”  Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Did Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He still won’t say how he got all those injuries...” Hagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your cloak.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Never mess with goblins, Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Hermione and Harry leaned forward.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort?
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

...” Harry clenched his teeth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

At once, Harry’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, that he would like nothing better than to strike — to bite — to sink his fangs into the man before him — “... three.” He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onward and then — His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying ... ?” “OUT!” roared a second voice.
Expected: 5

The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished.

Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.” There was a pause.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Reading between the lines, I’d say she thinks you’re a bit conceited, mate,” said Sirius.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Ron, give me that rat” “What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?” Ron asked Lupin tensely.
Expected: 3

He carried on emptying his drawers.

Could you give us a few minutes?” The goblin nodded, looking sour.

“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps?

“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window.

Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.

The seconds lengthened.

“Good gracious, is it that time already?

“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon.

They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally  swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.” Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore’s hat.

“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.

They are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.

He was very aware of everybody watching him closely.
Expected: 4

He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“How  exactly did you find us tonight?
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.

Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Can I tempt you, Marge?” Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He, Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“What’s You-Know-Who doing?” Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“You know, I was thinking today...” She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, “I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just — just do it ourselves.” “Do what ourselves?” said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Within a week, even those who had been eyewitnesses were half- convinced that they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then,  moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“ — and she can’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ” “Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly, “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.” Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?” Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the courtyard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Who else would have assigned us a biting book?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator.

Actual: 2

“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?
Expected: 1

“Umbridge looks like she’s in a really bad mood already...” Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking...
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do anything.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?” Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

I thought it looked different.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.”  “I forgot you’d already done it.

Did this mean he wasn’t a proper wizard?
Expected: 2

“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh, where’s my wand?” She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he reacted instinctively.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them.
Expected: 6

Curious indeed how these things happen.

Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster.
Expected: 6

Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe.
Expected: 7

These words came without his volition.

His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open.

Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.

Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, a Reallyl” “I DONT CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace.

“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.
Expected: 7

I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ” But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.

“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.

“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle pleasantly.

Harry had never seen her look so angry.

You are advised not to leave the house alone.

“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King’s Cross, remember?

“One alone could not have done it.

“How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?” He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it.

“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ”  “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re just about to start — ” “Be quiet,” said Snape coldly.

He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue.

But there was no mistaking him — “Tom — Tom Riddle?” Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him.

Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned.

A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.

“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency.

The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, grayish- white, against the leaf-strewn earth.

“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.

“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.
Expected: 3

There’s not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix ... or so Dumbledore feels.”  There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with the headmaster either.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“I mean, obviously it’s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object... I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though...” Harry did not answer; he was still feeling ill. “I’m going to have to do this tomorrow,” he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.

It started to rain.

“Yeah, I thought you’d say that.

“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear.
Expected: 2

Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.

“Are you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet?” Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance.

“She wants me to go with her, alone.” “Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.

Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius said he was bored?

Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause.

Let’s just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth!
Expected: 7

“Well, Mr. Potter?” Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridge’s attention.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

I don’t really understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.” The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well- informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

The knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes.
Expected: 5

Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?” “Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer.

“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat.
Expected: 5

The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Just now!
Expected: 3

“Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt.” Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like “Boys.” k k k  Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.

Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk.

“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them!

“Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,” said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye.

We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” “But there are hundreds of them!” Ron examined the lock on the door.

A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay.
Expected: 6

You never knew me then — Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten.

“You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat.

The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.

They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table,  shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle.

Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted.
Expected: 7

And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t it?” Agnes gave several loud barks.

“If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” “I can’t — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” “Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODSl SCUM CREATURES OF DIRV.” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with the luggage... Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!” A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clambered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.

“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.
Expected: 4

“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well- developed for such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of all — he had already  discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously.

A second later, Harry spotted something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.” Nearly everyone laughed.
Expected: 3

You may go.” They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.

“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.

“I’m so, so sorry.

You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord’s orders that I took up the post?” She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.

Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the others.

He stood up.
Expected: 7

“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped — ” “What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair.

Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day.

“Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.

“But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.” “If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers’s every desperate move.

A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others.
Expected: 2

Occasionally they would catch  snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.” While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,” said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside.

There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else.
Expected: 4

“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.” “He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “Can you confide in me what the mission is?” Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.

“I wouldn’t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made  in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.
Expected: 6

“If you want to join us, we need to decide how we’re going to — ”  “Where’s the proof You-Know- Who’s back?” said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.

Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak.
Expected: 7

He was not the only one: Many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.

George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.

I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.

For a bonus point ... ?” Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her being sacked.
Expected: 5

I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear.” Harry stared at Moody.

The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh.

“I think we’d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session, because she seems to be channeling his spirit.” “What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 5

He was sure he knew what was coming — “There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.
Expected: 3

“But I know I can’t.” More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit, and put it into his mouth.

“I’ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy.

“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter.

Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
Expected: 3

It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark.

Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.

This is just like magic!” The chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and before he’d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over — all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.

Professor McGonagall gasped.

“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising Ginny’s head again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

Harry let Lockhart’s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.” The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him.

“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.

“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.

As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.

“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter.

Make sure it was not in vain.

“Dad and the others’ll be out in no time...”  “Yeah, I expect they will,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings.

Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.

Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.

Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.

One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most interesting.

So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

What did they take?” “A ... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord ...” The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“I’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you?” “No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again.

Hermione ’s eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept.
Expected: 7

And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his father ... his mother ...
Expected: 4

“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you need to be careful.” “For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in — ” “I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her.
Expected: 6

Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re there to catch Black?” “Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said Mr. Weasley heavily.

I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal.

“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not that — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to write up Peeves’ report — go — ” Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs.

I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.” “So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.

“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on.

“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand.

“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the old toad comes our way.” “I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.” “Oh, I dunno ...” said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days.

The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

“There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, do I make myself plain?” “Yes,” Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

I think it’s a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students don’t normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.” They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke Shop, where they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn.

They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks,  horrified.

When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” “ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” “Well, yes,” said Hermione.

Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word ...” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.

Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning.
Expected: 7

I trust Severus Snape completely.”  Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself.

“ You know?” “Certainly,” said Snape.

What if he’s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst — ?” “Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or not — they’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone left from the Order at  Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go, Sirius is dead!” “But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream?” Harry let out a roar of frustration.

“This isn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go...” She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged... Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry himself?
Expected: 5

Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them.

“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he was nearer.

However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.

Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?” “Okay, okay, it was just an idea!” They relapsed into a prickly silence.

Well, there’s loads o’ good stuff abou’ them...” “Do you find,” said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, “that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?” Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles.

The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. “We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed.

How?” said Hermione, whose face was white.
Expected: 5

He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — had he been that obvious?

Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do.

“Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.” She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s most recent dream.

In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.

Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her.

In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his ... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.

Expected: 2

He couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people.

Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase.

A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t move or speak.

Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing.
Expected: 2

Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off.

In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space.

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.

Lupin continued to stare at the map.

Well, off you go, then!” Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail.

“Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere — “Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.

I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned — ” “But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady.

“The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower — ” There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf.

“ Who — ?” “I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it could’ve been — Lupin!” “What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself.

What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.

They all looked very pleased to go.

“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly.

He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him.

I don’t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.” Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.

Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.

“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a  glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “Why hide me, though?” asked Ron.

“Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” “Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” Harry asked loudly.

“I had a — a kind of — vision...” And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes... Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak.

“And quite a long story.

“So you have been to look for giants?” said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table.

From whom?” “From Professor Umbridge,” muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall’s beady, square-framed eyes.

When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there.

He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.

“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.

Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over.

“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a twisted smile.
Expected: 3

“Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!” “That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business — ” “ You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears were now reddening.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.” Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?” “Certainly not.
Expected: 7

“But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.” There was a very awkward pause.

The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.

He seized papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.

The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . . “Harry?

As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.

“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
Expected: 1

And lastly, your pretty little friend ...” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl.
Expected: 7

Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time ... and Mr. Crouch!
Expected: 4

Come on — Ollivander now.” Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table,  which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE — NEW PREFECTS.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner — ” “Why shouldn’t we be here?” said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Er — ” said Harry, “a dark shape ... um ...” “What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS?
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore’s passing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, “Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,” said Fudge sharply.

“Merry — hie — Christmas!

“Harry — there’s something up there — ” said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Stupefyl” They were no match for her, even though there were four of them against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, “why don’t you shut your mouth?” Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected Ron particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Harry, I’ve been thinking — you know what we’ve got to do, don’t you?
Expected: 4

I will take them from here.” She pulled the door wide.

Bout the size of a Pekingese.” “Sweet,” said Slughorn.
Expected: 6

Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hurrying along behind him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN Cheers, Hagrid “He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said Ron.
Expected: 3

And after last night, I see their point.
Expected: 3

“He works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him.

Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Sir, are you — ?”  “Water,” croaked Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

But on the other hand ...” He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Oh — sorry — ” He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes.
Expected: 5

I’ll never drink again!

“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff.

Expected: 5
Actual: 5

I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.” Fred heaved a deep sigh.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond — you were there, then?
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days .
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Before he could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him to his side.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“He always sp- spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron’s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn.
Expected: 6

Many people in the small crowd watching cheered.

He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin ... a tame werewolf — ” “You fool,” said Lupin softly.

She had sat up.

Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry’s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Cute, isn’t it?” said Cho happily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

LEAVE THE BIRD!
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view.
Expected: 2

“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Granger!

“This is the Potter boy.

You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

He’s locked away upstairs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“ Yes?” “I think they deserve rather more than detentions,” said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Well, tha’s why it took so long, see,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers — ” “SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at Ogden.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

Behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius’s duel with Bellatrix.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to  see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

It was enough.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ... but where is it?” Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“And then he will return to his bedroom.” Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.” You believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come and go, Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry scathingly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once more.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?” Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“I don’t see you risking your neck!” The little color remaining in Sirius’s face drained from it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“It’s obvious what this means.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly hair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show — ” Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry’s wrist.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

In any case, within a few months of the scene  we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.

The little elf stood feet from him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus ’s grave is conclusive proof!” “Of what?” asked Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Right,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.” Ron couldn’t resist it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,” she said coldly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

The reporter had reappeared.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose...” Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle.” There was a pause.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Harry Potter set Dobby free!” “Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning.
Expected: 2

I always hoped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter’s body.

However” — Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine — “we’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too.

Actual: 4

Harry kept glancing at the staff table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“I think she heard you.” “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“ ’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a mulish expression, “he’s our dad!” “And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?” “What does that matter?” said George hotly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant — ”  Ron turned a tortured face to Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Dip back down again — quickly — ” They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time, though!” And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s weight fell on his broken leg.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past.
Expected: 6

“My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky?

“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly.
Expected: 1

He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.
Expected: 1

“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,” said Lupin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore briskly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“You don’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake?
Expected: 6

Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“You’ll be teased something dreadful,” said Myrtle happily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“At least she’s a laugh.” “She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

He needed to help her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.” “But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“We ... we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.
Expected: 1

His comeback didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, “shall we get practicing then?
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

The Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was enough of a highflier.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He looked like an old man.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she asked, beaming still more widely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

In fact, I am neither here nor there...” He gave a small sad chuckle.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Dobby has known it for months, sir.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Griphook jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?”  “Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

I turned him down, though.” Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage — “Avada Kedavra!” And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away .
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Snape was holding his robes above his knees.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

The door right behind him flew open, and the corridor toward the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch- lit and empty.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!” “Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“Is that a crime now?” said Fred loudly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

I will give him his chance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” said Umbridge quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“What’s his name again?
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“He never managed to get all the words out,” said Fred, “due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.” Hermione looked very shocked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Why?” asked Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

I quite understand that your father’s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but — ” Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and out of sight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

“I mean ... you know ...” She looked carefully around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.” “I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate?
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below.
Expected: 4
Actual: 4

Then another voice said, “Harry, come on.” A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?” “The Unbreakable Vow?”  Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

The room went deadly quiet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” “Yeah, I am,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

If it were to help you, of course ... but no purpose can be served ...” “It can,” said Harry clearly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin black mustache.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.” “Not the way he did,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“You liked her, didn’t you?”  “Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry’s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

“I know that you were very close to Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

And you, Miss Granger — you can partner Miss Bulstrode.” Malfoy strutted over, smirking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.” Harry glanced at Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-boms’ greatest champion!
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

Neville’s lost one,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

“ The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’...” A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been his friend!”  “You’re wrong,” said Lupin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

He wants to be Minister of Magic ...” Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 2

He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect .
Expected: 7
Actual: 7

“Well ... that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.” “Look — ” “Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Look ...” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore — ” “Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly.
Expected: 5

She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.

“Hagrid — what’s that?” But he already knew what it was.

From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.

He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed,  and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts — A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack?

Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”).

“What’s the matter?” said Ron.

Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain- drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time aiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.

“Think my name’s funny, do you?

Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights — meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.

“Reactions not what they were, I see.” “You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly.

“Stomachache,” Ron grunted.

“How exactly did it happen, Harry?” Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.

“The question is how we’re going to get in there!” “But ... Harry, think about this,” said Hermione, taking a step toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon...

“Sir, no, don’t touch — !” “I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s suspicions?

Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind.

They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins,  marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.

“And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?” “That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!” Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing... Harry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated and found it deserted.

And then it came to him.

“Just drink this ... It’ll be over ... all over!” Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.

“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.

Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk.

Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.

“Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.” Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say.

“But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday.

“Give us more time ...” “What is it, Hagrid?” said Hermione, looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.
Expected: 7

What do you mean, sent?” He held out the note from Professor Umbridge.

“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!” Utterly perplexed, Harry got up.

After a while he said in a dull voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life.” “Join the club,” said Harry bitterly.

Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was  out there, but not daring to make an appearance.
Expected: 6

What on earth does that stand for?” “ Troll,’ ” said George promptly.

In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.

“She’s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?” But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.

They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.

“You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became.

He had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius... “Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.” “Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again — ” “ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione.

Then a voice yelled: “HARRY!

You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?” “He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him — ” “Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since!

Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?” Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof.

A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.

Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping.

“I did,” he said glumly.
Expected: 5

“What makes you think that?” “Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place...” Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp’s blood.

Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.

They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.

It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers.

Everyone out!”  It was very cold outside the car.

“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse.
Expected: 3
Actual: 3

Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 6

This one,” he patted the first horse to have appeared, “name o’ Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one born here in the forest — ” “Are you aware,” Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, “that the Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’?” Harry’s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 5

“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion.

They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.
Expected: 1
Actual: 1

... Voldemort had all the information now.
Expected: 7

Harry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous.

“Yeah ... I’ve said it before...

He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs.  Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads.

His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione’s jinx.

Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells — ” “He didn’t make a hobby of it — ” “He, he — who says it’s a he?” “We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly.

Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?” “What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?” continued Fred.
