Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?” “Oh, something really silly .

They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them.

The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts.

When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.

“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“What are you doing here, Potter?” “I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead.
Expected: 4

...” “You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage.

“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on.
Expected: 4

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.
Expected: 2

And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?” Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good.

“Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off — ” “Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.
Expected: 4

The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.

After you, Harry ...” Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again.
Expected: 6

But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots.

“It was a laugh, that’s all — ” “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny — ” “What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape.
Expected: 7

A Christmas surprise for my Luna.

Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.

Just so that you understand the term.

“Hermionel” Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed.

“I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.

However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas — ” “The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?” “Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said Snape in a dangerous voice.
Expected: 5

Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly.
Expected: 1

Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said Hagrid, looking concerned.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid’s cabin.
Expected: 4

“This is ... not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly.
Expected: 6

“It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously.

“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.
Expected: 2

“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.

It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — “Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no!
Expected: 3

They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.
Expected: 1

“Loo/c!” Something was shining on the wall ahead.
Expected: 2

Ugly Myrtle!

“Examine him.

Ron followed her.

A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.
Expected: 4

But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
Expected: 2

“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Expected: 5

Then a voice yelled: “HARRY!

Expected: 2

“I don’t like it,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Not what you’d call foolproof.” “You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I think you have earned that right.” Harry felt his heart lift.
Expected: 6

He knows.

“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.” “So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?” “Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the entrance hall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” Ron demanded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.
Expected: 2

“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation.

The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children’s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.

“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Because .
Expected: 3

“We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s.
Expected: 3

The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry’s mind.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Won’t you, Fred?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He turned to look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Finished?” said Harry irritably.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, “ That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

That’s sort of the point.” “When was it lost?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal — if it hadn’t been for the owl.

... Dumbledore would like you to show manners.

“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted.

Expected: 6

He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then — He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — Voldemort.
Expected: 7

Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.

...” “He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.” He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he’s been here ever since.” Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But why are you out here, Harry?” “Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

The journey has tired me greatly.” Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them.

“She and a couple of friends got into Snape ’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword.

He passed over Ernie’s navy concoction.

“She is always knocking — ” “I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur.
Expected: 6

He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.” Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“No wonder Snape’s after it!
Expected: 1

“Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?” “We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.
Expected: 4

“I beg your pardon?” “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry.
Expected: 7

“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd.” Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.

“I assume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said casually over Pettigrew’s head.

“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

“He got off he got off he got off — ” “Be quiet, you three!

“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin.
Expected: 2

Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I smell guilt,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

When they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’ back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world.
Expected: 3

“Professor,” he started again after a moment.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Anyway ... why aren’t you at the feast?” Harry shrugged.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?’ ” He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Let’s go.” It wasn’t going to be that simple.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He has braved so many dangers already!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I don’t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right?
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“No,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

...” She looked dreamily at Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk.
Expected: 5

The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” “And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.” “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” “Harry!
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Library?” suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Ron had woken up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone’s legs.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I think I’ll go to bed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

What exactly are they?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Did you ever get near any of the other giants?” “What?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

...” And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart- stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.” “So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So it went on for three whole days.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I ’ave been longing to see ’im.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ...” “It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Are you okay?
Expected: 5

Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight; one blink later, it had gone.

“A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves.
Expected: 7

“It is happening, Ron,” said Lupin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk- white and covered in blood.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.” “Me too,” said James.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It doesn’t , Harry, you’re just getting carried away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

... Oh, here’s George.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed.
Expected: 7

“Elf?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Oliver,” Harry croaked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Snape did not speak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?” “ Stupe — ” “Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Stand up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“There’s one of them now!” The figure was emerging from a side room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“See what would have happened?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I must say, I did think she’d keep her word.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He’s crying.” Harry blinked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Oh yeah — and they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang around for a few more minutes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s faulty — ” Both of them pummeled it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Where are the others?” cried Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“What?” he said loudly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in what Dumbledore had ter say.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

She hasn’t studied.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.” And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The cat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

And we’ve met them, and they’re happy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew.

“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?
Expected: 2

...” Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry stabbed the number nine button, the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry heard Hagrid ’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It left nearly six hours ago.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Then Professor McGonagall arrived.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Can we help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” she said happily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It was very lucky he was so thin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbersl” Ron gaped at her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

When he entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron’s bed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter of time.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He got angry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“That’s a horrible thing to say.” “That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Surely you’re going to say good-bye?” Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry was quite sure she was going to the library.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught.

“Come on,” Ron muttered.

Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued?” As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something.

An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts.

There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.

“What’s the matter?” But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak.

He felt very strange.

“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face.
Expected: 5

“Yep,” said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches.
Expected: 5

Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past.
Expected: 7

Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.

He took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.

“You don’t have to take my word for it.

Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

And he had promised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid’s totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant... How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?

“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant.

However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better.

“Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling with pride.

Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it.

He closed his eyes for a moment.

Phineas.” And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening.

The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page.

“No one’s lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in ages — ” “Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet.

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.

“What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.

His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and- black ring; he had already killed his father.

“Eat it.

“I haven’t done it either!” “Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!” “Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face anxious.
Expected: 3

He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.
Expected: 4

The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.” Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth.

It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.” “Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.” It was Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 2

“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line,” he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermione, shaking her head.
Expected: 6

“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.

You notice the abnormally long fingers?

His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.

“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered.
Expected: 6

“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round- faced boy struggling toward him.

“When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match?

“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.

“I’ve never seen him like that before.

Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.

A moment later the desserts appeared.

As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point).
Expected: 6

Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.

Did he dare move his foot?

...” “Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Then — “RiddikulusV’ bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry’s feet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“DOB — !” Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
Expected: 1

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years — “Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy at all.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It has been very dull without him, very dull indeed.” He settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?” “Harry, we weren’t — ” “Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“You have it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — “They’re going to crash!” shrieked Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I ...” He broke off.
Expected: 7

Today we shall discuss — ” Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn’t covered.

No broomstick would have a chance.

“Not — ?” “ Shhh\ ” whispered Hermione desperately.

“Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad?
Expected: 5

He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!” “I don’t believe this,” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around.

Wood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face.

Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it.

We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness.

“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good,” said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog.
Expected: 5

ATTAAAACK!” Crash — crash — crash — door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out.
Expected: 2

Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back.
Expected: 5

They could tell that my feelings were less — less human, less complex when I was a dog ... but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn’t trouble them.
Expected: 3

Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

I don’t want to hear “I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on.

Professor Karkaroff spun around.

“But you’re Mugglesl” said Mr. Weasley delightedly.

Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock.

Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“It’s just — I didn’t like her either.” Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
Expected: 6

But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard.

It did not work.

She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.

Actual: 7

He took Harry by the elbow and tugged.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power.
Expected: 3

It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Well done.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Who are you?” “You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice.

He threw his wand back into his trunk.

The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.

She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials.

“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.

A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He had no intention whatsoever of going there.
Expected: 4

He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he’d been in here.

“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione.

“He’s been attacked by a snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen.” “What do you mean, you saw it happen?” said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting.

She held up two plump chocolate cakes.

“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.

Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do?
Expected: 4

“Hang on ...” Harry muttered to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry stared at her.
Expected: 4

“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of parchment?” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“You saw what he wrote on the wall!
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?” “Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What — I don’t — ?” “Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

His brain felt like a wrung sponge.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Yes — yes — a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Her father picked her up last night.” “What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as yours!” he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid ’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...” “Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively.
Expected: 4

Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They can’t wait to get their hands on this!” She opened the lid.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Ron wasn’t back yet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined.

Harry hated the disappointment in his voice.

I told you this at the end of last year.
Expected: 6

Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup.

Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry seized it.
Expected: 2

Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?” “I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said Ernie swiftly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Hermione ’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Well ... well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but — come on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?” “Have you offered Cedric help?” Harry said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky Warlocks .

“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.

Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense.

“Writing!

He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.

“In here, Harry ... in here, and sit down.

Potteri How’s your head?

“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Hagrid muttered.

We can arrange transport home afterward.” “Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout.
Expected: 6

Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I’ll — I’ll be in my office, getting — getting ready.” And he left the room.
Expected: 2

Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Here at Hogwarts ?” “Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

... Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot — ” They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe.
Expected: 3

Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.
Expected: 1

“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

I won’t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn’t let go.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Oh no\” squealed Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

She — er — got a bit shirty with me.
Expected: 3

Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape’s dungeon, and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.
Expected: 4

Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Eh?
Expected: 4

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful.
Expected: 2

He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.

I was sympathetic, I was kind.

Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.

Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny’s expression.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione.
Expected: 4

The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey.

At last he found it.

“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I’ve had enough of it ... make an example ... where’s the form ... yes ...” He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.

“I’m all right,” panted Harry.

“I think it was my dad.” Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now.
Expected: 3

They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts.
Expected: 6

“But ...” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar.
Expected: 7

Snape looked more menacing than ever.
Expected: 3

“It’s got to be me.” He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.
Expected: 7

Harry’s dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys’ roof.

How — how did you — ?” “Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve learned to Apparate!” “ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry.

“Why don’t you come in?

Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table.

“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.

“Why not Madam Pomfrey?” “Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping.

Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale.
Expected: 6

Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather as he was.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.
Expected: 2

And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — “Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.

Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.

“It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“We need to talk,” she said.

What could he have been thinking of?

“He’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he?

“I got ’em ter feed ter Aragog.” And without warning, he burst into tears.

“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.

Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother.

Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.
Expected: 6

“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him.

He had a choice of paths up ahead.

Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight.

“And it’s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.” Harry folded up the letter, thinking.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Can you see them in your mind’s eye?” “Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was coming next.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?” “Right,” said Harry weakly.

“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.
Expected: 7

“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ...” Hagrid ’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“There just has to be!” She seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.
Expected: 4

Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.

Hermione screamed.
Expected: 5

Where was this place?

Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs.

“Where is he?” “I don’t know!” shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet.
Expected: 5

Had he been seeing things across the lake?
Expected: 3

He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“How d’you know that?” “It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work?
Expected: 7

“Come on, we’ll jump.” Harry hurried after her into the corridor.
Expected: 6

“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.
Expected: 5

“You were only muttering a bit,” he mumbled apologetically.

I should have done more.
Expected: 6

“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.” Harry had no retort.
Expected: 7

Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity.
Expected: 7

He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.

...” “Is that right?” said Frank roughly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t come to school.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

But he hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
Expected: 3

“Yes, he destroyed it.
Expected: 7

As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“What are you talking about, Weasley?” barked Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?” “I daresay you 11 find you can,” said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.
Expected: 5

“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.” “Oooooo ...” James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

To Harry’s consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem.

“But I really was rather hoping to speak — ” “We shall arrange for the President to forget to call.

You wouldn’t want to cross him.” Krum grunted.
Expected: 7

Both raised their hands to shoulder height.

Did it fall on you?” “No,” Harry called back, panting.

Fred and George Weasley.

“Now ... shall we proceed to the burial?” Hagrid nodded and moved forward.
Expected: 6

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
Expected: 2

“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I’m trustworthy — ” “AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Well, reallyl” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“So?” “Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I will kill him!

Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers.

It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.” “Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.” “And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
Expected: 4

Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.

“Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious.

Harry moved toward it.

But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office ?

He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him.

“He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything.
Expected: 7

Why not?

There was work involved.
Expected: 2

Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“What?” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here.

“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly.

“I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I’ve got to give out a few notices.
Expected: 2

...” The villagers exchanged dark looks.
Expected: 4

That’s what’s causing all this mist.” The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair.

It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.

“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Professor?” he said again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“The point is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm .

Hestia Jones broke the silence.

“It means that you are not a wizard.” “I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry saw it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Are you speaking to me again?” She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Hermione, however, looked alarmed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high windows.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Seven years there and he won’t know himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“We’ve come to take you home with us.” “But you can’t magic me out either — ” “We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning.

“It’s slavery, that’s what it is!

Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals.

To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.

They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger — ” “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Distracted, Harry looked down.
Expected: 3

No one said anything.

“Nick, you’ve got to help me.

“National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.” The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.” Hermione blushed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“And twenty points from Slytherin!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry struggled around to see who was half- strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

. . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...” Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Absolutely untrue!” “He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.

Don’t you see what I’ve done?
Expected: 7

But you 11 all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How can you be nearly headless?” Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You know, I’m surprised at you.
Expected: 5

He wished Ron would put his wand down.

“Jus’ fer stoppin’ all of yeh committin’ murder?” “You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian.
Expected: 5

Think about it!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He’d never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

His yellow teeth were bared in a grin.
Expected: 3

Dumbledore shook his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It was cloudy, Mum!” said Fred.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I need that room ... make him get out.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!” Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“No, I did not.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“The Muggle authorities were perplexed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Wings sprouted from each wither — vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Really — they’ll wake everybody up!
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

. . Limited.
Expected: 7

I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing ... maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s in the shower, Harry.” “Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Where did that come from?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower — ” There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn’t she?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

...” Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him.
Expected: 7

However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.

“Harry!

He had got so close that time...

“There can’t be anything there.

It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Where ’ve I ... ?” “Been, yes,” she said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.” “Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness.
Expected: 1

If he hadn’t been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie’s face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Not to worry, well find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” Harry took the wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Well ... I’ve got the book.” Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.

“Read it aloud!” Dear Harry, I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle.
Expected: 3

“Don’t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing!
Expected: 5

Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall.

Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the field.

“She set out to explore the house, I think.

When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework.
Expected: 2

She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s voice floated out of the window again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Get back!” shouted Hagrid.
Expected: 6

“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Classy.

Harry turned around, shaking with rage.
Expected: 5

Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, “You could do it.

Actual: 7

“This is very early for a call.

It’s okay!” “Harry, I can’t believe it.

She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Lord Voldemort is waiting...” Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Stupefy'.” Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.

The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold.

The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn.

Well, let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the decor.” Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit — out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut.

“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry — ” “Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?” said Ron, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.

He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared.

“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly.

Harry did not need telling twice.

As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up.

He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters.

I only hope we can find someone to follow ...” Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He banged on Hermione’s door.

“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?” Hermione put up her hand.

Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.

There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air — instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead.

Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall?

He thought of Malfoy shouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Expected: 2

As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.

No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air.

“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“What’s that?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history.

Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.

We are.” The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.
Expected: 7

Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.

“Ouch!” The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers.

It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other.

He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water.

I drifted off for a moment.

The doors clanged shut yet again.

The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.

I must confess ... that I rather thought ... you had enough responsibility to be going on with.” Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore ’s face into his long silver beard.

What?” said Harry.

“From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth.

...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade.

“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember.
Expected: 7

Funny, really ... he needn’t have bothered.

“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Let’s see ... ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.” It was a broom cupboard.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Know how to — ?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Just choose someone — better — next time.” He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

... Take your time, now ... then tell me what you see within it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“The rat — look at the rat — ” But there was a mad glint in Snape ’s eyes that Harry had never seen before.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Inspired!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” Harry’s heart missed a beat.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“So ...

“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

C’mon.” He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers.

My dad doesn’t believe it.

It was Snape.

“But you don’t know what the second task is — ” “Dobby knows, sir!

In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him.

... Cedric and Krum hadn’t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken the mersong seriously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?” Voldemort did not answer.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature’s began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said Dumbledore gently.

In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind.

“If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I going to get up there?” The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest.
Expected: 7

“Make it move,” he whined at his father.
Expected: 1

He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.

Actual: 7

When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?” “No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.

She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s name on it.
Expected: 7

“An’ I mean the on’y one.

Ron, hurry up and change.

Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.
Expected: 4

“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.
Expected: 1

Well done, car — ” The car, however, had reached the end of its tether.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“So, Potter ... give us a shout if you need us.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” Hagrid leaned across the table.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would’ve done everyone a favor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Hey, Harry” — Ron gave a great whoop of laughter — “Malfoyl Wait till he sees you on this!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Beats me ’ow ’e did it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

What did he have to do?
Expected: 3

He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex.

Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.

Actual: 7

“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Ah, she’s left it open...” Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

She nodded again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to the parchment.
Expected: 3

“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements.

Actual: 5

Spots that never come off, d’you know what I mean?” Snape suddenly did something very strange.
Expected: 4

“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I suppose it feels quite warm to him.” “Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Of course you care.” “YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Minister, listen!” Harry said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

’E is too young.” “Well ... it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry.
Expected: 4

“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Well, that can sometimes happen.

His hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It’d be really cool if you got on the team!
Expected: 5

. . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.
Expected: 5

And then — A cloud shifted.

’E’s ’Arry Potter!

The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want .

It’s the only way I’ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.” Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he’d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.

The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses.

“Floo powder’s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before — ” “He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred.

Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from Trelawney!
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.” Harry nodded.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors yet, has he?” So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were supposed to be out.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“You didn’t disobey orders at all!” Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a report to finish for the office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.” “We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape’s private stores.
Expected: 2

“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.

Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.

“Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.

Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.

Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Then it came to him — “Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They denied they’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand it...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“What’s happened to him?” “Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.

“I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house — ” “I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,” growled Moody.

He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.

“It’d be great to have a stock of it.

“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling.
Expected: 4

He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,” said Dumbledore in a low voice.
Expected: 5

They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though.

Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful — ” But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.

He would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay there all night if he had to.

“Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,” said Harry.

Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.

I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” “But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” “ ’Course,” said Neville.
Expected: 7

“Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork?

“If anyone deserves that place, he does.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He’s there now.” “Harry!” Ron said furiously.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Tiny black moving dots, labeled with names, showed where various people were.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents.
Expected: 7

As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.

It’s time.

“It’s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking something’s wrong.” He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.
Expected: 4

His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

As if it wasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part- Humans — ” “Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.” “I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him.
Expected: 6

It was a fine, clear day.
Expected: 5

“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries — ” “Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione hastily.

He could have finished him off for us!” Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark.

“Get back, you scurvy braggart!

The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit.
Expected: 2

“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him!

“Why did he — ?” Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Reductol” he said.
Expected: 4

“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked.
Expected: 4

He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors.

Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some water.

They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They’ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve stopped making them.

“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.
Expected: 1

Together they traipsed across the vegetable patch.

“Definitely dodgy,” agreed George.

“Do something,” he said desperately.

Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside.

Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on.

“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh?

“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed.

You’re setting them free when they might not want to be free.” “Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though her face was turning pink.

The silence spiraled horribly.

Harry was having a particularly bad time of it.

Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.

“Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.

“Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn’t it?” Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically.

One of them was lowering its hood.

Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.

“He hates me.” “Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around.

Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?” “Teach?” repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled.

“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.

They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.

“Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards'.” Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror- struck by his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby !

Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart.

“It is a start,” said Voldemort.

Right, follow me!” For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime.

He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.

They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room.
Expected: 3

It seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world... Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air.

“I — oh, all right then.

The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper.

Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night.

“And what do you mean, you’re my second?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“An’ you’re with me, Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however.
Expected: 6

“Pretty much,” said Harry, not looking at her.
Expected: 5

“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.
Expected: 5

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Get a grip.
Expected: 3

Then he went to Hedwig’s cage.

“They ... er ... they’re looking for Barry Crouch.” “Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

But what would he write?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“What’s a Howler?” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to pack something.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

... And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He was in a state of shock.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.
Expected: 4

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Then Dumbledore said, “Please explain why you did this.” It would have been better if he had shouted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I bet loads of people here can do it.” “Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron.
Expected: 2

“Well never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Dumbledore!” “What news?” said Dumbledore at once.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Next thing we know, Filch ’s cat’s attacked.
Expected: 2

“ ’Ole street blown up an’ all them Muggles dead.

Tonks was very interested in Harry’s vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.
Expected: 2

Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone\” Hermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry.
Expected: 7

Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk.
Expected: 4

“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And we saw the Devil’s Snare arrive.

Harry, however, thought Lee had a point.

“Well, it was a bad night for romance all around.

“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” “I don’t want anything.” “Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Ron started to direct the black pieces.
Expected: 1

The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks.

“I’m going with — with Neville.

“I’ve ... I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked.

He looked very angry.

“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ...” He stumped off down the stairs.

Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.

But the point is, the bones are no longer broken.

“They’re probably still in Azkaban.” “Azkaban?” said Harry, puzzled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

This is most unusual.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“It explained a lot.” “Did it?” said Harry in surprise.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He’s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.” “So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” “We’re doing our best,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It’s obvious.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He’s not as young as he was — though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry picked it up and felt it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see.

“Professor Snape made a terrible mistake.

Cedric’s footsteps soon died away.
Expected: 4

“We’ll be there in ten minutes.
Expected: 2

The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Just now!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They zoomed through it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The sky was getting a little lighter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The one your dad went to help this morning?” “Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I’ll sit over here with Weasley ...” She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow’s match.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” “We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said Ron miserably.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Your task is to retrieve your own friend .
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

We’re all in the same boat now, and, well — ” He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” “But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Would he be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’m coming with you,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before.
Expected: 7

More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic?

“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry bossily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

And what were Ron and Hermione busy with?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

But monsters don’t make good pets.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“In the living room.

Actual: 7

YOUVE STILL BEEN TOGETHER!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry was still pointing his wand at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Tonks!” “Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Together?” he said quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 3

“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable.
Expected: 7

Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes.
Expected: 6

His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I mean, that’s only the second time I’ve ever done it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining him critically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all right.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

But we’re being realistic!” For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, broken as Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Aaah ...” They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in the steamy window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“He said he’d come at four, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!” She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up.
Expected: 6

You’re staying at Hogwarts, then?

She was a great witch.

“You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I wonder why he’d do that?” “Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“You — ” Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“But he doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d ’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they?

Professor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed.

Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

We’d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ” “I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight — ” They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

But I don’t want you running away with the idea that I’m better at Herbology than she is!
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The smell of the forest filled his nostrils.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

... Trouble is, I missed the last one.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this.
Expected: 3

“He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him, sir.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.” “It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You’re late.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him — ” Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

There can’t be any other reason.” Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Why did you have to bring that stupid book?” “It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Don’t you dare!
Expected: 7

Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Spit it out, will you?” Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione’s pillow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Go quick,” he said hoarsely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I — ” “It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... C’mon now ... in the box ...” There was something familiar about that voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

...” They were back in Dumbledore ’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” “That’s stupid,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

A horrible, half- sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Look, he’s waving at you, Harry.” Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him.

“I assure you!

“Ginny\” It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Are you, you great ugly brute?” It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Those are cursed wounds.

“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably.

“I’d watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.” “Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“You know .
Expected: 4

He preferred to operate alone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left — ” “Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said anything — Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last.
Expected: 7

Harry’s included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch Captain.

They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day.
Expected: 7

Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.

Because Rita Skeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and I’m willing to bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into something sinister.

“You’re not going mad or anything.

So then I said, Altars Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.’ ” “Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, sounding rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?” “No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Dangling people in the air.

“This is it.

“They need squeezing.

... “Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding.
Expected: 4

These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Expected: 3

“No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry.

“I’m really sorry to get all upset like this...

“Look, they’re so sweet.
Expected: 6

And we’ve got all our books — ” He pointed at a large bag under his chair.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off.
Expected: 2

...” “Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.
Expected: 7

Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born.

“What are you talking about, Harry?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee!
Expected: 3

However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case.” Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.

“Hello, Professor,” she said.

“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.

He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn’t had in centuries.

Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, “So.

He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric.

“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said Hermione wonderingly.
Expected: 2

We’ve seen it before ... we could’ve stopped this from happening ...” “Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant?” said Ron sharply.

“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the engine had restarted.

“Yes, I am.” She nodded slowly, solemnly.

Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease.

It’s all right,” he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, “they’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn’t hard.” Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that evening’s task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.

He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.

“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again.

They didn’t seem to understand at all.

“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap.

“Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating.

Come closer!” Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.
Expected: 7

All Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would cause him to feel Voldemort’s jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr. Weasley was attacked...

“Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know.

“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand.

When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes.
Expected: 5

“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into the room.

“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan.

A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.

Harry and Ron looked at each other.

It looked like an unused classroom.

“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!” Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry’s furious stare.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted.

“My answer has not changed.” “I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep.

“Dumbledore — you can’t.

He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.

Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.

“Hermione, we wanted to buy that!” shouted Ron.

As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus’s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent.

Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.” They ran down the stairs toward him.
Expected: 7

“I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too.
Expected: 7

Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin overcoat.

“It’s the crack of dawn.” “Exactly,” said Wood.

You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now?

When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d check.” “But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked.
Expected: 6

He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.

“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination.

“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,” he went on.
Expected: 2

“So why’re we stopping?” The train was getting slower and slower.

Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement.
Expected: 5

“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.
Expected: 1

My father answered the door.” The smile spread wider over Crouch’s face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What happened, Professor?” “You may well ask!” she said shrilly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It would be such an honor if you would attend.

“D’you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle better?” He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of “Weasley Is Our King.” Ron’s ears turned scarlet.

Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.

“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny — ” “No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors ... describe them.” “Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now.

Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.

“Ouch!” “Shh!

The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling.

Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.
Expected: 5

What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.” “There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action.

The speaker was Draco Malfoy.

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts.

To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.

Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.

The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.

But he wasn’t really watching Buckbeak.
Expected: 3

I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.” A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.

“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly.

“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron.

His immediate thought was that someone, surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again.

He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.

“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background.

He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging.

Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible.

“I think that’s the worst bit.

“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron’s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.

“He’s gone to change into something more suitable, I think ... and he said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . . “Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched.

“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly.

“Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.

“Well, here we go.” Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then — He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes.

“Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year.

“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.

He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had “given himself away” at the Dueling Club.

“Felix Felicis?” he said.

He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.

“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,” she told them.

“We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen.
Expected: 7

Ron seemed to notice Harry’s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.
Expected: 5

Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff.
Expected: 6

“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are.

“I — I’ve already told you.

“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled.

“Sit, my children, sit,” she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs.

“Found the perfect place!” he said.

If this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.

Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 6

I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad.

The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary, though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly couldn’t have managed.

“There,” she said softly.

“What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” “I ... they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his hands curled into fists as he said it.

“Not so loud — just read it!” The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.

“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.” Professor McGonagall glared at him.
Expected: 6

“Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.” “So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, “and he found the place where you were all fighting.

“She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly.

The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight.

Perhaps she’d noticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone?

I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day.

He looked around the room.

“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.

But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance.” She hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort’s name, but stared at Harry without flinching.

He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.

It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction.

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.

They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds.

The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.

Meanwhile, the goblin and the house- elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool.

“And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!” Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.
Expected: 3

He also suspected that part of his mind — the part that often spoke in Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach journey’s end.

Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.

“What’re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?” Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his wand being ten feet away nothing happened.

It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.

‘He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.’ “This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school.

He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now.

It was now slicked down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill’s, but found he had too much hair.

Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker’s needs.

Over Hermione ’s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.

Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.

Still, you weren’t eleven every day.

“Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more.

Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?

“You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!” he said.

His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.

“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron.

Muriel might have stabbed him.

He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor.

“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.

“It is clear from your son’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again.

Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire “Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a little hand.

“I understand.

Yet this hopeful mood did not last long.

Harry pushed the door open.

I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness.

Snape had regained consciousness.

He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they stand for?

Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the champions and their partners — ” “What partners?” said Harry.

I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the Great Hall.
Expected: 7

“Well, if they end up having children, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.” They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them.

Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerked open.

“Now ... to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back!

He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.

Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.

“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be honest,” said Ron.

He got to his feet and stretched.

“IVoooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.

“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered.
Expected: 2

“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.
Expected: 4

“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s work.” He had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a contender.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Is this still something to do with wands?” Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting.
Expected: 7

I quite understand.

I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.” Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled.

“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t look at me — I’m ’ideous.” “Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa.

His lot aren’t very happy with you, are they?” “Don’t know what you mean, Sirius — ” muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever.

But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control — ” Harry shifted guiltily in his seat.

“There you go,” he said.

There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe.

He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.

“I need Severus.

“Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it?

Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.

It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.

“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione.

“I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it.” But what good were these words?

Yes, indeed, oh, very good.

When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.

“If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you’ve been expelled?

All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them.

They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were sure it was deserted.

But why didn’t you — oh my God — you should have said — ” She leapt to her feet.

He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm.

“They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous.

Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Can I ask you something?” “Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron’s face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Then we can tell them what we’ve found out.” They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open.

The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual.

Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: “...I smell blood.

“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated.

As a matter of fact I’ve never even used the visitor’s entrance before.” The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster.
Expected: 5

All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part!

No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt.

Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering.

Thank you, Kwikspell!” Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope’s contents.

Ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.

It’s obviously guarding something.” She stood up, glaring at them.

At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’ inter the caves, Macnair an’ the other one were sneakin’ round the mountains lookin’ fer us.

On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes...

“Why couldn’t we get through the barrier?” Harry shrugged.

He raised his wand, hesitating.

“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms.

Harry scratched his ear.

“Is this real?

“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley.

Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it?

The words wouldn’t come.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence.

“There wasn’t a card or anything with it.” To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there — but there were more pressing matters to deal with.
Expected: 2

“But she wouldn’t come.

YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!” There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps stopped.

“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.” Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You have been warned.” Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever he went.

It looked extremely old.

“We’re only borrowing this.

“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,” said Fred.

It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

How did you come by my diary?” These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He had no choice but to run for it — ” “Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Well, I’d better go.

Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.
Expected: 2

Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.

Turning to Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione?

He had never felt so angry in his life.

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.

He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again.

Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup.

“Er ... good luck on Tuesday,” she said.

History, alas, does not tell us.” There was a pause.

They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking.
Expected: 1

Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Woke me up!” “You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean.
Expected: 3

One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once.

“You\” gasped Harry.

They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness.

Come and see.” Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry’s head was swimming.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Well, Draco, what is it?” asked Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.” Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.
Expected: 3

“And now Rookwood’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?” “I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,” said Harry.

Ron clicked the Deluminator.

It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.

“My transformations in those days were — were terrible.

Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.

“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away.

It was hovering inches above Malfoy’s left ear — and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it.

She raised her wand.

“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.

There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys’ car.

Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs.

Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.

“Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more serious than Harry had ever seen him.

His lip was trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble.

He was more interested in her right hand.

“Are you serious?

Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.

Keen on his job, though, isn’t he?

He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children’s.

She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s chest.

However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them.

There was a long silence while they contemplated each other.

Ron’s greatest fear was spiders.

The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.
Expected: 2

Christmas morning dawned, cold and white.
Expected: 2

They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“You two carry on.
Expected: 7

“What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?” asked Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Surely a bit of a rest .
Expected: 6

“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest.

They had reached the edge of the forest.

Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d suggested him as Seeker in the first place.
Expected: 3

I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.” Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.

Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self- control not to spend the whole lot at once.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate — Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful... “WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?” “Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“And there’s a two-week waiting list.

Hagrid didn’t answer.

Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos.

“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ...” Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid’s.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat?
Expected: 4

It’s still a Hogwarts victory.
Expected: 4

... Relashiol” The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair.
Expected: 7

Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
Expected: 1

One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.” “What?” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Let me think — let me think ...” The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But Harry could hardly swallow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I believe you have an owl?” Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Yeh know she’s bin lookin’ fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home!” “I won’t!” Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It wasn’t even Voldemort.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?” But his question was answered before he could finish it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice... Don’t put your wand away, boy, don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?” It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the same time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like the bear-sized dog he had been.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.

...” “Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Not every day,” said Albus quickly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... “Lily, take Harry and go!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Hermione was dancing on tiptoes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Oh,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, we liked her...” “That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I must return to the Ministry.” He had almost reached the door when he paused.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

The Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

...” “Now, this one here — ” She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Headmaster?” It was Snape.

If he raided our house he’d have to put himself under arrest.

Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum.

Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.

They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves.

“Mr.

“Harry only — ” “No one wants to upset me!

It did not open.

I’ll have to make it sound convincing, won’t I?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Ron hurried forward and seized Neville’s arms; together, he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Lucky for them,” said Ted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

...” “You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Harry?” “He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

You look terrible.” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I’ve been there on holiday, did you see — ?” She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry’s side.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.” “Did you see anyone near here that night?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Well, if you see him ...” He left.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Whatever yeh say, blood’s important...” And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Harry, dear!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

An old man’s mistake ...” Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore made eye contact.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It was deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It’s like going out with the giant squid.” “There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s essay.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The Sorting Hat wouldn’t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Harry, behind you!” Harry looked wildly around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?” “No — never,” whispered Malfoy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“There have been no secret meetings for the past six months.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Moran!” It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and down in front of them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!” Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

For, though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 3

Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job.
Expected: 2

It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Said an incantation, did they?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They were coming closer...
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Who ’re you?” said Ron, staring at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.” “And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!” “I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” “D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I thought they were being watched now anyway?” “Well then, I dunno,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Show yerself — I’m armed!” And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Nor do the other house-elves.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

His cloak lay ripped on the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well- wishers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Then, at last, something happened.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this .
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He dropped his voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Dumbledore’s anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Tell you what, Dobby — here you go — take these two, and you can mix them up properly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I dunno...” Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” The Slytherins were cheering.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“His soul?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

More publicity.” “Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I know I shouldn’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything, but — The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Robbed us, mind, before she ran off!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?” “I don’t know,” she said hopelessly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Kindly respond immediately.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Here we are.” At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

... It’s down in the rules, you’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the best he — ” The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...” But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion- Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Come on, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my — my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Still, better than D, isn’t it?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

She landed on Harry’s other side.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Great lesson cornin’ up!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?” asked Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“ ’Course he will.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,” he said angrily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It was Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He had been inside Dumbledore’s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“What have you got to show me?” Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“And there were near misses, many of them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you 11 agree you need help.” There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- Know-Who?” “Good question, Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir — ” “I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry moved off along the teachers’ table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

... Well, something more ...” And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux — ” “Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!” “Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I want to see some punishmenti” “We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore patiently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“It would be dangerous for him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I can’t believe this!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” “Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred.
Expected: 3

Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!” Warlock D. J.

“Who’s opened it?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Draw, you knaves, you dogs!” They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Ten inches precisely.

It wasn’t just Ron’s eyes.

“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Lord Voldemort will provide.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“An explanation of an old man’s mistakes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“The place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase.

“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer.

At this rate, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.” “Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking alarmed, “Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last thing we want just now — ” “The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy smoothly.

Dead goats an’ such like.

Actual: 7

“No volunteers?” said Voldemort.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“See you in a bit.” He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

It’s not a joke?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Then a small voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?” “Er, yes,” Harry muttered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Yeah, I wondered.” “You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...” He tapped his nose again and strode off.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Not really,” said Harry coldly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The door in the corner opened yet again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig- strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“So I can do whatever I like.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He had never been in a wizard house before.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Yet there was no sign of a struggle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I mean ... you’d know, wouldn’t you?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

This made Professor Sprout very happy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“We’re friends.
Expected: 4

“Right,” said Wood.

Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet.

...
Expected: 4

“There’s an empty chair at the staff table.
Expected: 2

“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We were going to — to go and see — ” “Hermione,” said Harry.
Expected: 2

“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.
Expected: 2

“They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.” He turned to Professor McGonagall.

On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished.

“It fell right beside you, I picked it up.

“What’re we going to do?
Expected: 2

“Shall we — shall we do it, then?” The three of them stepped out into the back garden.
Expected: 6

“So, Potter,” she said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Are you all right, Harry?” “I’m fine.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Can I?” “I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!” said Hermione shrilly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There were times when I was almost myself again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The plates in front of them filled with food as usual.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Anyway ...” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape’s essay.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“ They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror?

The egg was lying on the table.

...
Expected: 3

“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I’ll write him a note, explaining.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

But the night’s surprises weren’t over.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Come now, Dumbledore ...” “As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,” said Dumbledore, “we heard Barry Crouch confess.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

. . and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape’s, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Definitely,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It’s me.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Dumbledore seized Harry’s wrist.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Haven’t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“It’s through here — ” He glanced around at them all.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.” Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the letter then, as usual?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He pushed the door: It was locked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!” He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Been absent for a couple of weeks now.
Expected: 4

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Even Snape?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You had your head in my fire.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yes, I’d have to say you do, Dursley.” He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Just trying to imagine what he’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Why?” “Why?” Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.” He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.

Actual: 6

“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Bet it tastes disgusting.” “Add yours, then,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I hope it’s Granger,” he said with relish.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He recognized the goatee ... it was Karkaroff.

A warm breeze swept the alleyway.
Expected: 5

. . their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.” At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.

Actual: 7

... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long.

“Our newspapers.

Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry’s feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Dad’s reprinting!” she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Little squirts!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...” When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d talked in days — about how no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron’s jealousy ...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

We’ll have to keep him.” Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.
Expected: 5

“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban.
Expected: 4

“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up.
Expected: 6

Never occurred ter me what he was doin’ there.

Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with,” she said softly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Something large, much larger than a broomstick — or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps!
Expected: 6

The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old Divination standby.” “What — make it up?” “Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not shamming sleep tonight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back.
Expected: 1

Harry stared at the dot.
Expected: 4

As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure.
Expected: 6

I left him with Viktor Krum.” “You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

People usually just turn up.

Malfoy gave a harsh laugh.
Expected: 6

He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them seats.

Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.

“It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you!

“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t sign the permission form.

Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.
Expected: 2

“I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.” “You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.
Expected: 6

“A double portrait, can’t do better than that, and well both sign it for you.” Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I imagined that people would panic.” “I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Harry, m’boy?” “I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see — ” “Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all.

I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog.

“Not pleasant.

“They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.” Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What about her?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

"... you know how to fix it?” “Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly.
Expected: 5

He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot.
Expected: 7

“Where’s my neffy-poo?” Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Sir?” Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with his finger.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.

They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything.

Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache.

Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.

The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.

No card?

We both know it!

As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“No sword,” repeated Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

What if I don’t care?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don’t you remember?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I thought they could detect underage magic!” “You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by — ” “Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled.
Expected: 6

A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Urgent.
Expected: 6

“Okay, team, let’s go for it!” Hermione ’s spell had done the trick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

You know full well I never listened ...” “No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under Dumbledore’ s nose.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You run round with a werewolf once a month — ” “Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on — ” Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them, Dumbledore — end of my career — ” “You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting.

“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him.

Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar?

“Is that you, Filch?

However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you 11 forgive me.

He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
Expected: 6

Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up.
Expected: 3

When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding.

It’s over, innit.

“Unusually bright.” “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“He didn’t like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.” She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside down, and began marking her answers.
Expected: 5

“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione ’s rigid face.
Expected: 2

Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song.

Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.
Expected: 4

But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army.
Expected: 7

The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” “Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry’s eyes.

Actual: 5

They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior.
Expected: 5

They both burst into speech at the same time.

They were whispering excitedly together.

They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them.

Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.

“What’s this?

He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

... “Expecto — expecto patronum — ” Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster.

Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?” said Ron, watching Harry closely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day.
Expected: 6

“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past.
Expected: 7

“He changed, Harry, he changed!

The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle.

They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.

Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him.

... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go.
Expected: 4

Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl.

It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out.
Expected: 5

He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“But I can’t ... we can’t ... I’ve got things to do alone now.” She did not cry, she simply looked at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... Let me go.
Expected: 6

Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him.

Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field.

“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them.

“Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?” he said.

Then he took a step closer.

“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry’s flobberworm was still alive.

I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!” “I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry’s seemed to chorus I am\ I am\ I am\ all around the room.

Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron.

C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of here — ” “I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet.
Expected: 2

Jus’ take off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready ter set ’em loose.” Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket.

His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.

The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck.

“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.

Slave labor.” And she refused to eat another bite.
Expected: 4

“I thought,” she said, tears spattering down onto the table.
Expected: 5

Then let me correct you — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment.
Expected: 3

“But they were our kind, weren’t they?” “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.” “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you?

Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.
Expected: 1

. . too far. . . . “My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked.
Expected: 7

“Wait a moment.” He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.

The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds.
Expected: 3

It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry told him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I mean — well — all right — ” He opened the door and they entered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said Harry slowly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Sirius shook his head and said, “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Oh a fine way to spend six months!” she shrieked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It is time somebody took this class in hand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Snape looked agitated.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him.

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I’ve got to go to the library!” And she sprinted away, up the stairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.” “OUCH!” Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry looked up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He glanced over his shoulder.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are they?” Seamus choked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“That’s not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your mother — here — ” He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud, “ Dad is still alive.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Quick!” Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!” “It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and Harry’s heart lightened considerably.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Red card!” said Dean furiously.

I have no secrets from you anymore.

His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Sirius’s letter was almost as short as the previous one.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

— he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because there was someone there!
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught.” “We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“And in your family, so in the world .

... Don’t push, there ... mind the books, now.

A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It’s amazing here in Egypt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But his cheerful mood didn’t last long.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Please leave — ” The door opened again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“But I’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get my drift.” Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who suddenly felt sick.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his report — said it was all publicity — ” But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder.

“That’s a phoenix.

Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I will face you.
Expected: 4

They stopped and looked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“But unless we can find more thestrals you’re not going to be able — ” “Oh, more of them will come,” said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’m trying to think what to do.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And he set off.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... Harry listened closely to the silence around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I thought we’d start today with a little quiz.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“You, too,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

You really were!” But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s in their nature ter look after humans, that’s what they like, see?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry gaped at her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He looked nervous.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Where were they?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He always had trouble remembering the passwords.
Expected: 3

Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And now his house has been blown apart!” “Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs.
Expected: 7

“On the count of three.

Under their influence, I became less dangerous.

The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts.
Expected: 4

“Someone’s fixed it — it won’t leave Harry alone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy — ” “But your mum and dad ...” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Look at this, Neville.

. . but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he gets back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at once.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Ron, catch — and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

C’mon, Harry.” They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

I was hoping to meet him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I don’t understand — ” But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Grief.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I know they don’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” “Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?” sneered Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Scared of passing the dementors?” Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“She is also a relative of yours?” “Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“We’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know!” And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“See what I have become?” the face said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee!
Expected: 7

I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Oh, very well,” he said slowly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been — ” “No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,” growled Hagrid.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.” “I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“It was not we who found him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Apparently he’s gone away again.” “Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

She read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“But Bill’s not that down-to-earth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“That was a nasty crash you just had.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public — “The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most contemptuous manner.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Good-bye,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Sorry,” he said impatiently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.” Hermione whipped around to look at Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few questions answered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?” “Not in the slightest,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Well, well, well ... Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore replied quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Crouch will need all hands on deck.
Expected: 4

“How about Malfoy and Potter?” said Snape with a twisted smile.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road.

Next thing we know — Creevey ’s been attacked.” “He always seems so nice, though,” said Hannah uncertainly, “and, well, he’s the one who made You- Know-Who disappear.

Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

No, what we wanted to know was .
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Add a clockwise stir — ” “No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

...” Hagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from the rest of the class.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The grin vanished from Fred’s face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was bad enough that he’d passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this fuss.

In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father.
Expected: 7

In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.” “The house?” repeated Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Another zero, then, Potter Harry was too incensed to speak.

“Right.

They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.
Expected: 1

The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Let’s go,” he said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

That wasn’t a happy thought, so the dementors couldn’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me sane and knowing who I am .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail.
Expected: 4

“Sure you don’t need a lie-down?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Listen, I’d better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back.
Expected: 6

“Spotted dick, look!

All those times I could’ve died, and I didn’t manage it?

Someone’s idea of a joke.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?” “Stung,” Harry muttered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet .
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I doubt very much that there is only one of them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort’s laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” “Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What?” She pointed at the window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“That woman Kreacher’s got a photo of in his den?” There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart’s angry voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
Expected: 3

“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Come to scorn at my fall, perchance?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Thursday afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

And — and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?” Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, “Remember all that water on the floor?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Then it flickered back again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the West Ham colors.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less chance of being overheard than in the common room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

His face was suddenly tense, alarmed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Three ... two ... one ...” With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left — it had stopped working.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I’m going down there,” he said.

He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore ’s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.

Some are going so far as to call Potter “the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.

Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that he was given extra homework — the only person to get any, apart from Neville.

He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.

Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.

The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.

Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
Expected: 3

Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner?

Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.

Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers.
Expected: 7

He’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.” Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain.

Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.

At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over.

Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away.
Expected: 4

We’re here.” They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage.

“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously.
Expected: 5

Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Petunia, any ideas?” “Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.
Expected: 2

Fudge will soon wish he’d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you...” “Professor Dumbledore ...” Harry began.

Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.

Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.

He noticed that her hands too bore the marks of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.

To Harry’s surprise, Hermione followed suit.

Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Try — ” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania.

They all looked very pleased to go.

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them.

He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked.

That’s what you want, isn’t it, Minerva McGonagall?

He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.

“Did you see the Malfoys?” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned.

“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet.

“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before.

Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely.

There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, “Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody’s got any objections.

“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty- five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk.

He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well.

Keep out of it.” “I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head.

“Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.” Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler.

Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again.

I shall review your case.

It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust.

No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can.

“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W.

He didn’t sound anxious — if anything, he sounded hopeful.

“See?

“Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry.

How much had he heard?

“They were abusing it.

He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.

He had never been inside it before.

“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them more tea.

“It’s never too early to think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination.

... Then, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I need to address the students in any case.” “All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock in the evening.

How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I know!” Harry shouted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I’ll go through first with Harry.” Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and apparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But you won’t tell anyone, Professor?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes, that would be it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“They’ll come back, they always do in the end.
Expected: 5

People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk.
Expected: 3

Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They placed them carefully at the Horntail’s side.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s — stick close, now.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch robes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Let’s think,” he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

...” “Tent?” “In the bag!” “In the ... of course,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

No arguments!” He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Yes ... please pack away your things.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He was dead.
Expected: 4

Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

They had lost everybody except each other.
Expected: 7

“I’ll speak to Griphook first.” His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.
Expected: 7

Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other.
Expected: 5

The pain of it was making his eyes stream... “LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

This isn’t justice!” “Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go saying things like that to his boss!” said Hermione, but she too looked very upset.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.” They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.” Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Yeah ... both orphans.” He took a great swig from his tankard.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“He doesn’t need to, Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Stop that,” said Ron sharply.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way — Voldemort was laughing — Harry tripped.

Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he said seriously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry pointed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.
Expected: 4

Harry noticed him glance at the fire.

They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.

On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 54.

“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it.

They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision.

“Must’ve been — what — fifty feet?” “We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was shaking.
Expected: 3

“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?” Harry nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.

James had showed it to me just a few days previously.

“I couldn’t hear anything.

Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears.

Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.

He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it.

They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly.
Expected: 5

“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?” She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you.
Expected: 7

Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this.

He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.

“Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it — ground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a fast kickoff ??

...” Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing.
Expected: 2

A few Order members have been tracked that way.
Expected: 7

“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“But where’s — ?” “Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not — but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind — “We will fight!” Hermione said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit battered.

“The post office, Harry!

“You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape too.

They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible.
Expected: 5

Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go.
Expected: 7

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone.

“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron, looking over his shoulder.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry — ” “They won’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You flew really well — ” “You did brilliantly, Ron!” This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back through his shock.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It was just that I wanted to pack tonight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry knew what was on her mind at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!” Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back, his hand over his nose.
Expected: 5

“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.
Expected: 1

Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall’s voice, magically magnified.

“It’s all my fault.

This is not an equal competition!

Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before.
Expected: 2

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.
Expected: 7

“I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside.

The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar.

“Grawp’s about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,” she snorted, “as Hermy.” Ron gave a nervous laugh.

“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.

he asked himself.

“I’m going to find Scabbers in a moment — Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione ’s shriek of surprise.

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 2

The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed.
Expected: 4

There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“He’s tethered in me pumpkin patch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — Harry “Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?
Expected: 1

“He was furious...” He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

It’s just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case!
Expected: 5

He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.” “What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said Ginny, as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake.

Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.

Ten of spades: violence.

Then — “Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag.

... One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother .
Expected: 7

Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.

“What happened, Harry?

“He told me she needn’t have died.

“That’s chess!” snapped Ron.

The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost.

The door creaked open.

Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.

“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said.

“Feeling all right, Harry?

Harry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.

“What about poor Scabbers, eh?” He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.
Expected: 3

Then he forced it into an awful smile.

“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.

Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I’m going to ask you again!
Expected: 7

Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look.
Expected: 5

Harry turned over.
Expected: 2

The skin mended.
Expected: 4

New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts.

“I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

No point pretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.” Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.

It was not only the students’ mood that had changed.

Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.

Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s fate that seemed to worry people most.
Expected: 2

Isn’t he cute?” “Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon.
Expected: 4

It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy.

Ron was on his feet.

Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

“Well, you’ve done a good job on them.” “That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid, nodding at Ron.
Expected: 2

“Off to bed with you.” “ ’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins.
Expected: 5

“My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.

He wondered whether he dared ask.

She wanted to talk about Cedric.

There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family.
Expected: 1

The gigantic powder- blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid’s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it.
Expected: 4

In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
Expected: 1

What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it?

“Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ” “Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 3

“It should’ve been Cedric’s, he got there first, you take it — ” But she backed away from him.
Expected: 4

“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly.

He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the D.A...
Expected: 5

She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“You’re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes glittering.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco.

Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

All three glasses vanished.
Expected: 6

Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort.
Expected: 7

Something was wrong.
Expected: 7

Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Just some stupid teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously.
Expected: 6

The whole Ministry’s been working on it for months.

And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.

“He was caught shortly after yourself.” “Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening.

“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards.

She merely smiled her mysterious smile.

He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train.
Expected: 6

She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.

Ron went brick red.

His Patronus flickered and died.

Tut, tut ... even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister.

...

This is a lie.” “It is NOT a lie!” said Harry.
Expected: 5

“Cissy, your own sister?
Expected: 6

“Says he heard an intruder in his yard.

Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

They have probably already profited from the traitor F irenze ’s teachings ...” “Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime... We do not touch the innocent.

...
Expected: 6

“I’ve heard Dad talk about him at home!
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide open and empty.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I really fancied finding out what old Snape’s been up to.” “Snape?” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“But that’s ... that’s N.E.W.T.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He can’t avoid us forever.” “Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But the chance had been snatched away from him — Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.” “What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Nightmares?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Snape didn’t seem to find it funny.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come back as a ghost.” “What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

...” Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at a run.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Why?” he said again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It was not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Lee was still commentating.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

... Just answer no.
Expected: 4

“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!” “A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!” “Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I will inform Professor Binns where you’ve gone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... Don’t worry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice from a long way off.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

And where was Ginny?
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I am the true master of the Elder Wand.” A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Speak not the name!” “Sorry,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...” Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Really great.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further...” Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“No one regrets more than I — ” “You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The light was fading fast now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ... just like him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It hurt.” The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Mum and Dad won’t be too pleased.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They couldn’t be here... Not in Little Whinging ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ” “Go away!” Hermione squeaked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?” Neville looked startled, but said, “Well ... always the same hat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They’ll kill us if we miss it.” Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize power.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“ Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry moved his head over on the pillow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Ask for his help, then double-cross him?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Draco Malfoy looked at him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Looks like something’s attacked her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

She just didn’t want to go with Neville ...
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry — I can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky in case the owl is intercepted — we need to talk face-to-face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

They got out of the car.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll send it on...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s my fault, isn’t it!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

— ‘and we’re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.” Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

That’s when I open my trunk.” He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” “There is no help possible.” “Then explain ... more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“She’s bored,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

...” “Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

... Where’s Hokey?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I’ve had enough.” And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig’s cage under his arm.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I’ll write again soon.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

. . but he shouldn’t think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn’t want to ... or did he?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable Braking Charm.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything ...” “Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?” “That,” said Harry, “is a really good question.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The golden grilles clanged shut behind him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“No, no, no!
Expected: 6

It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Surely she would.
Expected: 6

“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,” said Professor Sprout.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

You know, just vanish and reappear at home!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

. . but we will give you time .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was more than one.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“ — Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on remorselessly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“ — someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw — ” “Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Not Mum, though.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... “There you are, Potter!” Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

If there’s someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light up and spin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi — “No, Potter!” screamed Snape.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?” This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew ... “I was the snake,” he said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And of the other three — one of them’s caved in, so no one can get through it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Are you Harry Potter?” Harry did not recognize the man’s voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Snape rounded on her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Every morning the ground was covered in frost.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it) with flaming-red hair.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“What the — ?” He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

For a minute, neither of them spoke.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves them or something...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He gave the wall a little push.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages without owls.” Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“If you insist ...” The office dissolved but re-formed instantly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“ ’Bye then!” But Stan wasn’t paying attention.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Later!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He had failed: The snake survived.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.” Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“She’s cried a fair few times, yeh know.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But if it is,” he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” “Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.” Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“No, it’s not,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

’E eez in ze smallest bedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.” Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

... Rise again, indeed — ” “But you just said it!
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron’s head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless — ” “Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Harry didn’t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

How old was your opponent?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

... Where’s Snape?” Professor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite teacher.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He had turned white.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.” “Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she — ” But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“He trusts you so, Severus.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of course.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry blinked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Very good.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

We’ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.” At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry felt a bit better.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

"... and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. . . . “And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Why?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry’s bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hopefully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.” “What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?” “He works in the most boring department,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along too?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how could he have forgotten, why hadn’t he thought of it before?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Wait!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered haughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach — the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Hogwarts business.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

You are not aware that you have broken any school rules?” “School rules?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

We saw him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him?
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry looked around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“My turn ...” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at  the cat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Still ... you’ll show him, Ced.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Unbelievable.” “We’d better get going,” said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle’s thick wrist.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks conversationally.

But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house — ” “Alone?

Why even touch it?” Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore.

“Let’s forget it and go back.” “IVo!” Harry hissed.

The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Their ears seemed sharper than usual.

The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn’t really want to know the name of at the moment.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Little woman.

...

This struck Harry as slightly odd.
Expected: 7

They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Why do you think — ?” “ — Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry, struggling to keep his temper.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“She’ll be perfectly all right.” “No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.” She suppressed a sob.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face...” “Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them, “Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Yes, the last and worst.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“It means the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.” There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

What happened?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Miss — er — ?” “Granger, Professor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I think he said he’d been too busy.” Sirius paced all around the cave in silence.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst.
Expected: 7

What impostors?
Expected: 7

“The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of imprisonment ...” Harry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn’t he?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“He wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.” “He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione wisely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...” She was holding up a small, circular mirror.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry told Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after he’d stopped laughing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How very touching .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But he took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

She was still trembling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?
Expected: 7

“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he wished it were.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I’m not talking about big articles.

He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How could he ever have thought them ugly?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every direction.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He could feel himself shaking.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You wouldn’t understand, you might even attack yourself!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others.

Actual: 6

Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his badge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“A maze.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He could feel everyone else looking around at him too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“... makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It would have been yours.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section.
Expected: 2

“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” A magic wand .
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

In fact, bring both, while you’re at it.
Expected: 6

The huge eyes blinked and vanished.
Expected: 2

“Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly.
Expected: 3

You’ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself.
Expected: 2

“Well just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“R — r — riddikulusV’ squeaked Neville.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” She looked nervously around and hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.” It was true that going down to Hagrid ’s at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid ’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course — Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Ouch!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And let’s see who else — you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?” It was a tense moment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Dear Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.
Expected: 2

He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 3

Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And then — I dunno — I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.” “She’s part veela,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“They let me out of St. Mungo’s on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning.

On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,” he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Unbelievablel” beamed Seamus.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He turned and looked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

They pelted toward it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it must mean — The yelping stopped abruptly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry got to his feet to face them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!” “It is not a question of your bravery,” said Firenze, “but of my position.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.” He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped open Hermione’s letter and read it out loud: “ ‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there, “ ‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He looked rather bored.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like that.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The corridor was deserted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Was it your scar?” Harry nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you won’t let them.

"... yes — look!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I’m no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing.
Expected: 4

Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

George?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ” Harry gave a hollow laugh.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry.
Expected: 6

“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher.
Expected: 6

“Errol’s a family owl.

Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends.

“Harry?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“There’s only one vacancy, isn’t there?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Come on, let’s get going.” They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Really?

Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Something was slithering up from its depths.
Expected: 2

I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion.

“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” Harry felt himself go red.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry looked down at his own wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

A — a Horcrux?” Harry shook his head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“ Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.
Expected: 6

The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, “you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” Harry looked into the fire.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

...” “Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s possible.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“No deal,” said Ron flatly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.
Expected: 5

On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever.
Expected: 3

Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.” Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke.
Expected: 6

...
Expected: 3

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital.
Expected: 5

“Shall we go?” Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.
Expected: 7

“Bill!

“If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.” Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore ’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron scathingly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Come on.” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.

Expected: 6

Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.
Expected: 3

“It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.” It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I wonder why he’s ... ?” His voice tailed away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We have much to be thankful for.

Actual: 7

“And where have those girls got to?” She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.
Expected: 4

Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!” Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had .

Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.

“When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’ ” There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“We’re getting there!
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
Expected: 1

I could not possess her.

... “We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“So ...” “So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

How was it at Won-Won’s?” “I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... Snape ...

“Now,” he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known.

They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all.

“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy.

Actual: 6

It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.

Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“What was it you wanted to tell him?” “We ... we wanted to tell him it’s r-ready!” choked Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

... It’s not as though I really wanted to join.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway “There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Harry swung round.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Should we write back?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

There’s nothing written in his diary.” But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?” Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.

Ollivander swallowed.

Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“But — ” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper.

The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.
Expected: 6

“Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff.

“Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory.
Expected: 3

Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, don’t mind me ... I’ll just lie here and crumble.
Expected: 7

“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

...” He looked curiously at his cousin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Hermione ’s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.

“They’re horrible things, those dementors.

“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“I want three-hundred- and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” “How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

You had no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.
Expected: 7

I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest.

“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I’m okay, I’ve got a report to finish anyway...” Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Jus’ maybe, them that don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains, an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly to ’em... Could be they’ll come ...” Snow was filling up the window now.

That’s a good one!” howled Myrtle.
Expected: 2

“Harry!” squealed Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Pretending he hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Handy if you want to make a quick escape.” “And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,” said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.” There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, “Remember what was written on the wall?

...” “Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!” The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

. . tall and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort’s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like his wife.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Nobody in the kitchen spoke.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.
Expected: 7

We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we?

Bungler if ever there was one.

“ ‘Spew?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it.

“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered.

“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge thickly.

Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He got into bed, yawning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby’s.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

As the lamplight fell across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was missing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood’s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Can I touch stuff with the sword?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I knew it!” “Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Detention!” she shouted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Right again, Hermione!” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, “I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” “Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“But to the Wizarding community at large ... it’s all perception, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Get in here!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

You did more.
Expected: 5

Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.” He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He carried on emptying his drawers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all “Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“He’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!” But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But you were now accompanied by somebody else.” “What?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry, Fred, and George followed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry swore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

There he was, the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking. . . . “No ...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...” They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred and George, and walked back through the hall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

We don’t really need it anymore.” “And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.” “Not too far from here ... ,” Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...” Just then, the front door slammed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

That’s a basilisk, listeners.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Well have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.” He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry snorted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“That is — I don’t know — is a man alive if he can’t be killed?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He turned to face the black flames.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

... “So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It began to vibrate.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Dumbledore didn’t answer.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Look!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

. . the boy who survived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is — ” The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He arrived at our house near midnight.
Expected: 4

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Did you issue him with an invitation?” Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch ’s grip, looking furious.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died?
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of him after a while, I must admit ... so we split up on the journey home... She promised not ter tell anyone though...” “How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Promise me you’ll look after yourself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“She’s like my sister,” he went on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?” Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

That’s what you’re up against.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I taught him!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Well?” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The attemp’s cornin’ on fine.” “Hagrid, what’re you up to?” asked Harry seriously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6

George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But why are you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.” “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said Dumbledore kindly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“You keep your eyes shut!” He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Think that matters to them?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

... Hermione’s leg gave a nervous twitch next to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Saintlike,” he murmured.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I extracted this memory with difficulty.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I didn’t,” she said, wiping her eyes angrily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

...” “But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,” Harry persisted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Ooooh — who?” she said keenly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it’s a witch.” At this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: the locket ... the cup .
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn’t ... but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry!” He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... down ... Something gold was glinting just above him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Where are your parents?” “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Was that true?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He now proceeded a little more cautiously.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an urgent whisper.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.” “I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

. . things.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It’s right there in front — ” But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?” “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.” She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long- lost battle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“OY!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hermione and Hedwig had gone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We’ve forgotten the way to our common room.” “I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Bit of a comedown for Mr.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I was thin, very thin .
Expected: 3

The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Yes, exactly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Like Filch ’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Black’s audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore ’s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don’t see it as that important these days.
Expected: 6

“Not in the Prophet, was it?” “Hardly,” chortled Dirk.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

‘If it was me, I’d hunt him down myself.

Harry couldn’t help laughing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Well, the answer’s no, Albus.” He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a run fer their money.” “You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor Flitwick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?” The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron led the way to the Great Hall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had died.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn’t ... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him — “Harry!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But ... but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I’ll go and call her and then — yes, very well.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.” Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a memory.” Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin.
Expected: 6

Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard.
Expected: 2

“So be very careful!

“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily.

“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini.

“He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names ... he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place.

Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

And again Harry understood without having to think.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The bird stopped singing.
Expected: 2

It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.” A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry had no time to reply.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I am not such a coward.” “No,” agreed Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“The dementors should have arrived by now,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It was extremely comfortable.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” “Right,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Stay on the path, I’ll come back for yeh!” They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“No,” said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Ginny giggled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell — also, Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 7

When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.” “Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to PotterwatcM And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.” “You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked Ron, looking stunned.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“This,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left- hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Yes ... “First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“So noble!
Expected: 2

“But I should have died — I didn’t defend myself!
Expected: 7

There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“And you too, Dilys!” A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

James turned on him.
Expected: 7

“Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard?
Expected: 7

I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days.
Expected: 2

Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable.

Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.

“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.
Expected: 7

“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly.
Expected: 5

“You’ll have to tell me when you’ve found out.” “What d’you mean?” said Ron.
Expected: 3

The man’s eyelids flickered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Brilliant,” he said softly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Someone behind him was laughing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“We’re bein’ watched, Ron,” he said gruffly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

This didn’t worry Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir!
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

A thought had just occurred to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop.

Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Don’t be stupid — ” “Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now.

k k k The second detention was just as bad as the previous one.

This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench.
Expected: 2

Voldemort has been restored to his body.” Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They had, however, given Harry an idea.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Hang on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!” Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Dead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

No one ever did.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

...” Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

. .
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?” “It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He had never received a birthday card in his life.
Expected: 3

Expected: 5

“Voldemort was after your time.

“Oh, wow!

Harry leaned farther over the banisters.
Expected: 5

The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

You gave Ron the Deluminator.
Expected: 7

Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Sirius is waiting for us there.” Harry nodded.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch?
Expected: 2

Harry hurried into the living room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

’ Gotta go .
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“No, not another word of complaint, Potter!
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George’s jokes, stared at it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn’t had it signed, that was no good.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Please do not speak about Neville’s parents to anybody else.
Expected: 4

Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I’m not sure he’d be pleased if he knew!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Find Peeves!” “P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?” The girl nodded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.” Neville went scarlet.
Expected: 3

The exam results came out on the last day of term.
Expected: 3

“We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and — ” “I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

D’you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera hopefully.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

How could they ever make up for this?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Search me,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I won’t bother in future.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione approvingly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Dear Tom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint all down my front.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Dying?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He couldn’t ever remember feeling happier.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s office and take what we need.” Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of- the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“All students to return to their House dormitories at once.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I just don’t know how we’re going to let him know.

“Stop it!

“Fenrir Greyback!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Why?” “I don’t want to wake anything up.” “What d’you — ?” “I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.” Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Get away from him — I said, get away — ” Harry raised his head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry looked curiously at the goblet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Dumbledore raised his hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

... You know how these spells come and go.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“We go on through here.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

. . see to the fires and so on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Give me the sword as well.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“You wouldn’t ... you won’t... ,” gasped Pettigrew.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“And we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick!
Expected: 6

The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something... Yeah, it’ll be all my fault...” “Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done anything!
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- Outer.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

What’s a die-dum?” “Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry’s right.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Anything I can do?” “No,” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Ruddy livid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

There were rocks littering the lake bottom.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

What is it you’re after, Tom?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Then you can come back in.” Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?” “Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

All that excitement .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there.

Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return.

Expected: 6

... You found him inside yourself.” And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

You know — Accio.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Robes, jade- green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

...” The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Had they been unblemished and unmarked too?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

... We don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“What an interesting insight into our justice system!” “Blatant corruption!” roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Bagman’s whistle blew in the distance for the third time.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,” said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

... Malfoy would get back first .

The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.
Expected: 7

The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“It is a Gift granted to few.
Expected: 3

Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“There was a locket.” “What?” said Harry and Ron together.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He reached the door untouched.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I cannot lose Luna.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?” “No,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.” “Genius!” yelled Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

You don’t think a skrewt — ?” “Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,” said Malfoy softly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

... And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’ll do it,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

And they couldn’t risk him getting better, could they?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Is it that snake?” “No — everyone’s fine — ” gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it was on fire again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Eh?” said Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he jumped when Snape’s cold voice came out of the corner.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I can just tell.” “The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“It’s pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches.
Expected: 7

...
Expected: 4

...” And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!” “What do we do?” asked Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Hmm.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Got to be seen to be doing something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What’s happening?
Expected: 5

Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“C-cars, Molly, dear?” “Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to Harry’s great surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know...” “We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Take care, Harry,” said Lupin quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

... “Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Okay, men,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.” “What d’yeh — ” “I don’t think you meant to kill anyone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Oh, she was sorry she’d ever laughed at my glasses.” “Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?” he hissed, his face now a rich plum color.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Not Potter’s Army.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Would someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come back?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I thought the map must be malfunctioning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“That’s good,” said Ron fervently.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“This isn’t like last time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“We all ready, then?” They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Hermione, help me!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely “Penelope and I have got a bet on,” he told the team.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He was looking pale and stunned.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It’ll help you think.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He picked up Ron’s letter and unfolded it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead...?” Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Well do it, Oliver!” said Angelina.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I let you sleep in my bed\” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Hermione hitched it up out of sight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It was Professor Dumbledore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Well, I’d better get going.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The cat was still there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Everyone’s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — ” Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

This is the place, Harry, just here.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

‘Yeh’re a monster an’ yeh should be put down.’ ‘Yer mother killed innocent people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a lake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Get in the house.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful — but certainly not angry and scared.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

What was going to happen to him?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?” Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Even as they watched, stones flew upward, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“All right?” Harry whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.

Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.” “Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess,” said Lee.
Expected: 7

...” “Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He could not think what it was doing there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Well, I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.” He said nothing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“What?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They entered Snape’s office, shivering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I could help them.” Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Couldn’t see a thing, so I made some stuff up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

... How long had they been away?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Second one killed this term,” he explained.
Expected: 2

“Tea, Marge?” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her.
Expected: 3

Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry’s head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

What danger you are in?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember — ” “Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

For a few seconds they stared at each other.
Expected: 5

Ten points if you can get it through her stomach!

“Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again.

Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary.

“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat.

Uncle Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.

“But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

His chosen path seemed completely deserted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It seemed to be a trapdoor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A few more of the portraits had stirred now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“And what did you tell her Ron’s got?” “A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

It had been such a good dream.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Just let him go,” Harry urged.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He looked strangely familiar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” “I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“We’re attracting too much atten — ” “Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“He’s gone!” “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” Harry said, even more quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Hermione’s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I’m actually going to be able to remember it for once — ” He waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He certainly looked unhappy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“On the walls?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.” “Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, counting on his fingers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

They didn’t even mention Cedric.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Blimey ... inspectin’ people, is she?” “Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin- bags just inside the broken gate.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Excellent!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.” “Excellent!” said Harry happily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“What sort of objects are Portkeys?” said Harry curiously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Snape appeared there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” “Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.” As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Who needs that sort of prejudice?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Ron held it at arm’s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

...” “You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,” Dumbledore repeated firmly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as though desperate to free himself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: Dawn was approaching.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

‘Dreadful’?” Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“We’ll take separate stalls.” Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“That’s from my father.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“The Ministry of Magic don’t think you were helping Sirius, do they?” Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Do you deny it?” Pettigrew burst into tears.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Euphoria, I take it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...” Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

"...
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I regret telling you such a foolish story!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“New teacher,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.” Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

’Alf-giant?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Why do we have to be up so early?” Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Evening,” Harry said stiffly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“If she just acted like she was sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I didn’ know he’d bin Lily an’ James’s Secret-Keeper.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I’m freezing,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.” Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m sharing?” “Do not say the Dark Lord’s name\” spat Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The mustache bristled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

We should be starting this week.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry peered at it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to clear off for a week.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Nearly all the programs are following You-Know- Who’s line, all except Potterwatch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

... He’s packin’ now, o’ course.” “He’s packing?” said Harry, alarmed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Don’t you?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Go on!” said Harry urgently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Fred and George’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Gryffindor- Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy'.” too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry’s — Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted “ Expelliarmus'.” It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It was quite empty.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Maybe someone came ter call earlier an’ I missed em.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

When Harry awoke he looked around at Ron’s bed and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“See yer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

...” It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He played Quidditch for England himself, you know.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” “Snape was trying to save me?” “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Mount your brooms...” Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Talking in your sleep.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,” Mr. Malfoy told our reporter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

No, that’s not my guess!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.” Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I don’t want to.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“The moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“That’s better,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...” “Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“How are you?” “Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“They’re really sorry.” “Don’ — don’ matter ... He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Harry?” They looked at each other for a moment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ” Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

There were two in there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.” Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!” Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He couldn’t afford to let it happen again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Dumbledore was looking unusually grave.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

’ ” “You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

. . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a big forest, isn’t it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I can’t play to save my life.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.” Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then he reminded himself that dummies could not hear anyway.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Already the sun was low in the sky.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Tomorrow evening.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Stitches ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...” He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“It’s got a few tricks up its handlebars now.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

...” “Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

So I bet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Percy’s been under a lot of strain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, “we might get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“They’re very clever.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The tunnel turned and turned again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

All the time I was watching you ...” His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Snape was back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Yeah, I have!” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore, I mean.” “Right,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

She went on, more calmly, “Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” And with that, she stormed away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Ready?” Harry muttered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“A real honor!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

She sounded terrified, but convincing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I offered you the chance to tell me freely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...” “Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Ah, here we are, look, this is us.” They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“What was — ?” She was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Other teachers were not so generous.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

There was something in this room he wanted very, very much... Something he wanted... or somebody else wanted... His scar was hurting.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...” But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he’d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

James roared with laughter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“More ... wondering ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“My master sent me word of my father’s escape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“It was an accident!

“ — mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent — ” “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?” She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He raised his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It’s okay, Beaky, it’s okay ... ,” Hagrid said to Buckbeak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts?
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“That’s hardly one swallow.” They looked at each other.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly.

They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward.

It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Oh yes, you do,” said Dumbledore, still more calmly.
Expected: 5

Potter Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He was so angry he could hardly speak.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part.
Expected: 6

He glanced up at the staff table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 6

Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak.

When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope.

Actual: 5

“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron, shaking his head darkly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“No,” croaked Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don’t think any of us were expecting that!” “What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven ... Bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast — ” Harry hurried over to the stove to help.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Tell the truth!” He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“You can’t kid me!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I was sacked three days ago!
Expected: 6

Go and lie down.” She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn.

“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.
Expected: 3

“Delicious girl ... What a treat ...
Expected: 7

“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for so long.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn’t Petrified.

Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry shrugged.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I know,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . . “ Dobby ?” said Harry incredulously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“You’ve been ill,” she finished.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.” “Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!” “Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore.

A quiet, private funeral.

He could not understand how it had happened — Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm — Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore ’s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood.

“No!

Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed.

“Hello there, Harry!” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“He too was exceedingly arrogant.
Expected: 3

“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.

Actual: 5

Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Like you told — ” “Can anyone confirm that?” Harry didn’t say anything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.

He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.” “There’s something else,” said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion.

“When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to disarm them — we don’t want any accidents — one .

Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He ran back down to the common room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You know how greedy they are, they’re bound to eat them.
Expected: 2

After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione ’s feelings.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Ron didn’t answer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Well go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Weasley, I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“That was a Disarming Charm — as you see, I’ve lost my wand — ah, thank you, Miss Brown — yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Its power is mine!” “You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you?
Expected: 7

“Didn’t you know?” Hermione asked him, wide-eyed.
Expected: 5

“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.

“All this new security, an’ kids are still gettin’ hurt.

“Don’t know anything more about it than you do.

Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.

You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible.

Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,” said Voldemort.

“You should have left him to me.

“I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him.” Hermione let out a long, slow sigh.
Expected: 5

He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard.

Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted.

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves, his eyes dancing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Level with this door.” He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he’d been burned.
Expected: 2

Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.
Expected: 4

They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand.

For once in your life, hold your tongue.” “But if — if there was a mistake — ” “KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged.

“A fine example to set for your children .

He gasped.

Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.

Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues and vases.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He is too great, too good, to lose.
Expected: 2

“Dear, dear ... his own son ...” Harry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There’s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village!” “I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said Neville.
Expected: 7

Hadn’t it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed ... ?
Expected: 5

“My old House, you know.” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice.

Ron scowled at Percy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Hermione!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a hippogriff.” The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.

“Pity sugar makes it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.

“I hope he’s trying to help Cedric as much!” “He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.

Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.

Actual: 5

She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.” The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly than before.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Have you seen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

We must be nearly at Hagrid’s by now!” Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.” “Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,” said Neville, “but she was really pleased.
Expected: 6

He looked suddenly alarmed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He looked ill and exhausted.
Expected: 3

Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“This means, if we can just get the snake — ” But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys’ affections.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

And now she’s found out about poor old Bertha going missing, so that’ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

If so, he had been wrong.
Expected: 7

“Fred and George did.” “Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” “Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much ... not to his face anyway ...” “When can we take the actual test?” “Soon as we’re seventeen.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Harry who?” He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Do it, Harry — look inside him!” Why was it so easy?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It’s time you learned some respect!” “It’s time you earned it,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair.
Expected: 5

Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down.
Expected: 7

Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.

“Good luck, Harry!” called Cho.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Why not?” “He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the true reason.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,” said Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Did she get you in to have a look at me?” He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.” “Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.

“He’s sleeping.

...
Expected: 3

“So he could know what we’re thinking right now?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

— and Madam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a bit.” As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“We don’t care about staying anymore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You aren’t passing out anymore, are you?” “I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,” said Harry dispiritedly.
Expected: 3

“OK.” The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June.

“Had it in her hand.

Bodies everywhere.

Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

... How could they prove it had been he who’d made her do it all?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“On the contrary ... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Nobody seemed much disposed to follow.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.
Expected: 2

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
Expected: 1

He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions — for full details, see my published works.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I’m standing here with a wand — I’m about to kill you — ” “My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that.

Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
Expected: 1

Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn’t the only one.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded George.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

"... your time’s half gone, so tarry not Lest what you seek stays here to rot.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?” “Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a hurry.” They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned, of course.” He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.” “He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror- struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

His heart was beating very fast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

And he scrambled around to Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Harry Potter?” said the girl.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone — anyone — ” The snake’s tail whipped across the floor again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass.
Expected: 2

“I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.” His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry’s than anyone else’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose.
Expected: 4

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

His face was livid with terror.
Expected: 2

The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I’ve told you a million times.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves?” Harry looked at him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He was looking around at the wrecked office.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Hermione gasped.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Miss Granger, you know the law — you know what is at stake.
Expected: 3

“What’s the plan?” “Plan?” repeated Harry.
Expected: 7

Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges.
Expected: 7

“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on Harry.
Expected: 3

He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.” Harry unstuck his throat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles — ” “It wasn’t me — and how did he know?” “He works for the Ministry,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School.

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar.

“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.

“Had the whole week’s, my lady!

“Aragog!” And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly.

...” Harry summoned what remained of his courage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors!
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Okay, Harry?” said Hermione, turning to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry pushed his porridge away.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What is it?” “Stay where you are.” “I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — ” But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of Harry’s hand up level with his eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

SNIFF — SMELL HIM!” Harry was on his feet, ready.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.

Snape stepped forward.
Expected: 2

Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been one of the things to which he had been looking forward most.

All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed.

Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.

About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.

“You must hope not.” “Aren’t — aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at another hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking.

“Ron, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?” “Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron.

It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.

He had very good reason to be suspicious.

Dumbledore shook his head.

“That was clever.

Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring .

Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.

“What’s this, Hagrid?” Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mr. Hagrid, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.

Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.

As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely.

Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built.

Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell was that about?” “I’ve no idea,” said Hermione.

The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.

“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper.

“And quickly.” She strode toward the door and held it open for him.
Expected: 6

I would like you to join us too.” As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry.
Expected: 6

When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

What can he do about it?” “That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated.

She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun.

Expected: 6

Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.” “All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
Expected: 6

Harry’s insides plummeted sickeningly.
Expected: 5

Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.

“COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!” But a reckless rage had come over Harry.
Expected: 3

One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes.
Expected: 5

Due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you.

“I just made a mistake, that’s all!
Expected: 3

Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!” “And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry.

“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble.

“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it.

Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction — But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts.

When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened.

He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder, sneering in just the same way.

“You-Know- Who ... returned?

“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.” Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.” Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them.

Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.

The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations “Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag.

“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.
Expected: 3

Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over here, please!” Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See you in a minute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through.

“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always worked before, I just can’t understand it.” “It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can’t come off,” said Ginny “But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione.

“I’m going for help!” He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.

“That was nothing,” said Snape.
Expected: 7

“It can’t be B — U — M — ” “No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her.

There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil.

“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,” said Dumbledore simply.
Expected: 2

... Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore ’s face.

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.

“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said Fred shrewdly.

“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves?

“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked.

Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down.

Actual: 3

“Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided.

“But five minutes only.” And she let Ron and Hermione in.

“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry explained.

So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.” “D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off toward their History of Magic classroom.

When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.

“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.

Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention.

He was back to normal.

“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.

“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.

“Well, well ... I’m impressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry’s face.

Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.

It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file.

“Don’t call him Vickyl” Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd.

“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.

Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years!

Harry sat.

As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.” Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.

Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill- assorted feet hit the ground.

He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy’s fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.

Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes.

And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.

The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist — Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt.

He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, “You are — er — prepared to take Harry’s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?” There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling.

The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile.

Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely ... At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.” Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.

You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I’m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.” There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron’s face.

Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her, and aimed another spell at him.

At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.

“The Memory Charm backfired.

“No thanks,” said Harry quickly.

Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.

Sorry, Molly.” The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.

Maybe next time ... if there was a next time ... she’d be a bit happier.

“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached.

“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron.

“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said.

It is a school of magic.” There was silence.

“Absolutely not, Creevey, go!

Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.

We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic.

Moody didn’t.” Dumbledore cleared his throat.

She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them — but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.

Nobody seemed to want to touch him.

Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity.

... A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams.

Feeling dazed, Harry left.

“Just the man,” he said.

“Very useful, Potter, I thank you.

“Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him.

Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.

Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L.

The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display.

In front of the whole school?

“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.
Expected: 2

“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.

What would Ron and Hermione say about this?

Colin saw it through his camera.

“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking hands.

If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.

At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

His nose was also slowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.
Expected: 2

Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.

“That’s the post office — ” “Zonko’s is up there — ” “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ” “Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Could the old owner be right twice?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.

After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.” Dumbledore nodded.

If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.” k k k The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning.

She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip.

There were rumors that the job was jinxed.

“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes.

Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.

“They were starving him, Mum!” said George.

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

“Can I use it safely?” “I think so.

“It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time!
Expected: 2

Harry slid down the wall.
Expected: 2

The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” Dumbledore bowed his head.

“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf.

He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.

I’ll just have to — oops.

He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor.

“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.
Expected: 6

I’m not botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that.

It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley.

George’s grin faded.

“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they?

One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them.

“Branstone, Eleanor!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” “Cauldwell, Owen!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” “Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid ’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.

Lavender just got the news today — ” Lavender wailed loudly.

What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask?
Expected: 7

They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

There was a large package tied to its legs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Amusing, really.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

There were a few people out in the grounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe — “Hedwig!” Harry gasped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.

Actual: 5

Most unluckily it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.

“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans.

“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast.
Expected: 6

Harry’s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It makes me safe, you see.

Harry stared.

He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally.

. . things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape’s defenses accidentally... Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him... What was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He was expelled from Hogwarts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

... Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head.
Expected: 2

Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat.
Expected: 6

“Here, have a sweet.” “Eh?

The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent.

Actual: 5

“I booked it!” “Ah,” said Flint.
Expected: 2

He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.
Expected: 7

“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Ah, and this must be Petunia.” The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces.
Expected: 6

It was bleeding freely.
Expected: 4

... “Then .

“Don’ listen.

Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.
Expected: 6

The only things left out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.

He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting.

“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.

“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands.

Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.

Actual: 7

“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him.

I had to track these people down.

“Just look around!” said Harry.

“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.

LUNA?” “Harry!” Hermione screamed.
Expected: 5

“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus.
Expected: 3

As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“He ... he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.
Expected: 7

But his wand had gone.

“Well ... there yeh are... Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh come back.

“Winky’s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back down.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“How good it is to be here, how good.

Actual: 6

He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He was there!” shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!” “Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

What did this mean?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“What?” Harry urged him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Voldemort’s lipless mouth was smiling.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Have you got a spade?” And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it.

It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.” “So you think Snape could be up to something, then?” asked Harry, but Hermione broke in.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on this spot.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they — and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“ ’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.
Expected: 4

“What are you whispering?” said Myrtle, staring at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds.
Expected: 3

“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Ministry’s got to act.” “I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Aye,” he said thoughtfully.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Though if he’d only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently... She had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse when Harry had asked her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.” Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

There are some wizards — like Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than everyone else because they’re what people call pure- blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same.
Expected: 4

“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends.

She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.

Harry jumped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last — Something brushed his ankles.
Expected: 5

We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s another ten Galleons.

In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t see him laughing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What do we have to do?” They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

. . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there?” “How do I know?” bellowed Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Remember .

They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?

Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar?

Actual: 6

“And just as long as you don’t start snogging each other in public “You filthy hypocrite!

Everyone got quiet.
Expected: 3

“Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,” he said quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Getting back into the tunnel was difficult.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Harry turned this news over in his mind.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Hermione burst into tears.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He drew a deep breath.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“How much — OUCH!” Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too.
Expected: 6

“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?” “No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape’s desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

One of them’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can’t get out of it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Then he appeared to come to life again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Ignotus Peverell.” “Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Those people’s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again.
Expected: 4

“Well ... goodness knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same, Potter ... I’d be happier if a teacher were present.

The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you.

These people are trying to capture and kill you!

“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said brightly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“And I’ll get us some programs, look — ” Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

“It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see.

“It’s — ” But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.

“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically.

“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.

Aaah .

The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre- match pep talk.

If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you.

Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.
Expected: 7

But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.

And how did the mysterious Ariana die?

Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.

Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it.

“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” “Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.

Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault.

“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.

“He’s mine.” Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s Cross station.

“Sir?” said Harry.

Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
Expected: 3

This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.

Leave me alone!” The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street.

“A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.” “There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!” said Ron hotly.

Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle’s out-of-order bathroom once again.

“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again.

The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house.
Expected: 4

“Yeah ...
Expected: 4

“They reckon I started too big.

“I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking scandalized.
Expected: 3

White fog was blinding him.

And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following.” “You didn’t see anyone else?” “No,” said Ron.

The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.
Expected: 1

Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator.
Expected: 2

“Yes ...” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it.
Expected: 3

“Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject.
Expected: 7

... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor ... At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us the new password.” “It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said Hermione impatiently, “but that’s not the point — ” Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping.
Expected: 2

They wouldn’t look twice at him if he couldn’t do that Wonky- Faint thing — ” “Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth.
Expected: 4

“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.

... Well, faking his own death had worked once.

“It’s polite, see?

Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard.

Birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away.

Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove.

“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates.
Expected: 4

The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
Expected: 7

“You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.” “This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . .
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.” When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Shame on you, Phineas!” “Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet- eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

You two — Crabbe — Goyle — ” She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn’t he?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Oh, and dear” — she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up — “after you’ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Do you really think he’s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we’re there?” She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s basket as she spoke.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The class looked around as the door opened.
Expected: 4

“Hagrid’s record’s against him.

It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair.

It fluttered every time she snored.
Expected: 4

“So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority.
Expected: 7

Or has this been happening inside my head?” Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.
Expected: 7

Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them.
Expected: 5

He turned very slowly to face the empty room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.” Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters!
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

On Madam Hooch’s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

For a few seconds, they didn’t move.
Expected: 2

“Password?” she said as they approached.
Expected: 4

Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.

“What — what are you doing?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s progress through the air.

“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads.

“Without any supper?” said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom.” Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job — ” “He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.

“Do use your common sense.

“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,” said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!” “Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

She was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

What if I accidentally let something slip?” “ You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?” roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised.
Expected: 3

“You all right, Harry?

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.

’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry.

Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.
Expected: 5

“The other one — George or Fred or whoever you are — you’re with Remus.

“Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?” “Well, that’s what I thought too!” “Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.” She stared at him, openmouthed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, “Oh look at the weeny owl!
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

So that’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start.

Actual: 6

“Rather a shock ... My word ...

It would have meant admitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I’d led others along with me ... and Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me.

“Give it here.” Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper.

“I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount.

“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,” said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“It’s too late.
Expected: 7

The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey.
Expected: 7

“No — honestly, it’s okay.

The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter.

I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.

A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.
Expected: 6

I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was.

Ron obviously felt the same.
Expected: 4

“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him the same thing, so ... um ...” It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
Expected: 6

He was shaking his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I was a Seeker, too.
Expected: 2

Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.
Expected: 2

They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Now, you two had better listen closely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You wait, when I’m seventeen — ” “I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Expected: 3

“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.

“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.

Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.

‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . . ’ ” “Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed.

“That is the question, isn’t it?

He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint.

“No, you see ... Rita Skeeter” — Hermione ’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus.

He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I don’t understand.” “What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at her son.
Expected: 7

I wonder .
Expected: 4

He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita’s invention.
Expected: 7

I saw my mum and dad ... they came out of his wand.

“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal peril.” “It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open.
Expected: 6

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists.

“Mum won’t let us near the meetings, she says we’re too young — ” But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.

“I knew it!

He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it.

His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart.

And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
Expected: 5

Harry looked over Hermione’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque.
Expected: 6

“You .

“Knew\ Of course we knew!

He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.

Who ’re you takin’?” “No one, yet,” said Harry, feeling himself going red again.

“Term started more than two months ago.

Expected: 3

Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section?

Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk.

When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys’ dormitory.

It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.” Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk.

What could possibly do that to a ghost?

Then he said in a quiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black?

Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears.

Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.

Because if you have, I must insist — ” Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance.

He raised the sword in both his hands — The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth — But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow.
Expected: 2

Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth.

But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up.

“No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.” And so he had.

Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?” The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit.

Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, throwing him his present.

Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.

From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans.

It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.

“His memory’s gone,” said Ron.
Expected: 2

“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled Snape.
Expected: 3

Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.
Expected: 2

Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.
Expected: 7

“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid ’s bucket- sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid.

See you.” Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
Expected: 2

Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him.
Expected: 6

What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“True.” Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.

The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Felix Felicis!” “No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.

The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already... Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted...

The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted to beat it away.

“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,” he said, forcing himself to remain calm.

Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away.

The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away.

Harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him.

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
Expected: 1

“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly “He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder, too.

“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus.
Expected: 1

He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the time?
Expected: 6

“But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom.

It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.

“Couldn’t hold these for me, could you?” “But — ” Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers.

Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors!

“He’s dumped them on my bed.” “You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won’t have much time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley called down the table.

At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.

“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry.

“Reparo\” hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself once more.

... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.

There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad.

“She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ...” “Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.

“I wish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions.

The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared.

“Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history — lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere — ” “He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Expected: 4

I require your wand.” Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife.

One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding.

She was saving Crouch a seat, right?” “Right,” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.

The pain vanished.

Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.

To general indignation, a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled.

“No one’s,” said Ron.

The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.
Expected: 1

This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.
Expected: 3

But he must be brought to his senses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators.

And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it .

The turban fell away.

As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin.

Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day.
Expected: 4

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” More silence followed this little speech.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Malfoy would probably tell us anything.
Expected: 2

She had her own wand out now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!” He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty years ago... And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room... ’’You ’re less like your father than I thought...
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry moved forward.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.” “What do you mean?” “I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...” He raised the wand — Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her.
Expected: 4

“There’s nothing we can do!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

... Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch — ha!
Expected: 6

This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk.
Expected: 3

Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Dumbledore’s trusted me.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.” “Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Wouldn’t it be ... forgive me ... more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?” “Do not pretend, Lucius.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come — ” “My dear boy!
Expected: 2

Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

They could tell her — I don’t know — that Peeves is up to something awful as usual...” “I’ll do it,” said Ron at once.
Expected: 5

“Lumosl” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again.

“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood.

From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.

Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling.

The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.

“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter.
Expected: 2

“You’re going out again,” he said.

I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — ” “That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

What happened?” Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“NOOOOOOO!” Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself.
Expected: 3

“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
Expected: 1

Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

But why would he want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I think you’re right,” she told him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Professor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter — a word, if you please.” Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk.
Expected: 4

She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid heavily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“No — no — not again, please — ” It sounded as though someone was threatening him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Come off it,” groaned Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Every single wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.” “So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.
Expected: 5

Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price.” And he spat in her face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?” “No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.” Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“And what’s that supposed to mean?” “Obvious, isn’t it?

It soared in a great circle and then plunged once more into the trees.
Expected: 5

You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some — ” “Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.

“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.

“Now, Potter — ” He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego\” Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
Expected: 5

“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate.

“He’s g-g-gone!

The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.

She moved forward to look through the side of the tank.

A second, very small parcel contained a note.

“Oh no, no, no.

Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort ’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb.

“Hermione?” They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious.

“I was lost — Floo powder — ” Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands.

“Nothing,” said Lupin.

“It’s great being back here,” said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady’s friend, winked at him from her frame).

Harry hastened to join them.

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was.
Expected: 2

“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck.
Expected: 2

He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and- orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille.

Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, “Daddy, look — one of the gnomes actually bit me!” “How wonderful!

“Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.” They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.

“Well,” said Harry.

“And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?” “That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!” Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands.

Harry had reached the shed.

It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid ’s name last year.

“Ron — ” But Ron held up a hand to silence her.

“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron.

“I’ve got to!

Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence.

“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous!

Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.

“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too.

“You may stay,” Firenze told him.

It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.
Expected: 1

There was a sudden movement behind them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Just standing here and watching it happen?” He hesitated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet- black hair.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He pulled out the map again and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head.
Expected: 6

“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.

“Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a momen’, so I can ... fill yeh in,” said Hagrid.

I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody.
Expected: 6

Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You too, Harry.
Expected: 5

“What?” she called back.

The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.

Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things.

“Where is he?” yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the ground.

There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.

Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And talking about Michael and Ginny .

A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.

We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little longer.” “You will, will you?” Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both.

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles.
Expected: 6

“It’s fine,” Harry assured her.
Expected: 7

Still, I suppose it’ll help in the long run, won’t it?” He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him toward bed.

“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly.

“Better hurry up, hadn’t we, Molly?” she added, checking her watch.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t ...” Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.
Expected: 5

“I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there.

The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him.

The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him as rather ominous.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?” “No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.

Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.

His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.” “The diary wasn’t that special.” “The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” “So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry felt a great leap of excitement.

Take your time.

At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared.

“Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.

“Can you hold him still, Harry?” “Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily.

Ginny gave a gasp of horror.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.

Hagrid was already waiting for them.
Expected: 3

Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died.

Lupin flung out his right arm.

Someone else must’ve done it.” Ron raised his eyebrows.
Expected: 4

I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, “Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” “Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!” A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white- blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves.

“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — ” “Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione.

Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.

“Weak chest.

“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ” All three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He was trembling... Snape could be back at any moment ... but Harry thought of Cho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.
Expected: 5

Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed.

Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.

On this map, I mean?” “Er ... yeah, I did ...” Harry admitted.

Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward.

“Hagrid ...” “I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em cornin’,” said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin.

Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.
Expected: 5

I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.” “No, actually,” said Hermione.

There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.

“Can you do that, Dobby?” “Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf.

“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, “where they’ve got everything.

“You must be back to normal by now, we are — ” But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door.
Expected: 2

... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don’t we?” Harry got up and crossed to the door.
Expected: 2

They were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting.
Expected: 5

There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.” Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door.

It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.

“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.

He turned to Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 4

“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
Expected: 7

At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying.

All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.

“It’s nearly eleven — the match — ” Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.

It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight.

He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing.

“Here?

“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

He couldn’t.

“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.

“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and Snape ’s profile, which looked angry.

I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection.

“No blood?

“I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,” whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt.

Harry’s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table.

“I think that’s everything.

Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach.

There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them.

“Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!” Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office.
Expected: 6

“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened his mouth.

Filch rounded on her.

Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do anything.

“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.

Harry was sure it was moving away — moving upward.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too.

Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” He glared at them.

He thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use.

“You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and Goyle.” The three of them stared into the cauldron.

The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents.

He wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all.

George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Why didn’t I see it before?” “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.
Expected: 1

He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it.
Expected: 6

They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wizard chess.

Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.

“Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?” Ron laughed.

After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione ’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago.

“How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed troll ...” “Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked.

“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.

He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care.

“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously.

Pretty firm with him.

“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen.

Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.” “Hang on,” said Ron, frowning.

They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.” He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.

Didn’t I tell you?” As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermionel” He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It was the Mark, I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!” Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“A fever or something.

His scar gave another, more painful, twinge.

A large black and silver volume caught his eye.

I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes.

And then — it seemed like about a second later to Harry — Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“It’s Ron’s dad,” he said, sitting up again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“How do you know?” said Harry urgently.
Expected: 5

Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore ’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.” “But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.” Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order’s charms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

. . Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’ How very touching,” sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins.
Expected: 4

He stood up, looking around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It isn’t being ... kept for anyone?” Mr. Borgin squinted at her.
Expected: 6

Nearly everything in here was broken.

So anyway,” he checked his watch, “phase one is about to begin.

“Harry?

“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face.
Expected: 6

Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding.
Expected: 3

“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed.
Expected: 7

“She ought to be here in about five minutes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Open up, we want to talk to you!” There was no sound from within.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He couldn’t see how Ginny could still be alive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry’s room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“And now, it really is time for bed.” Harry got to his feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing — ” “I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Do you understand now, deluded ones?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“The Death Eaters who went free?

Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.
Expected: 2

“ — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years.

She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles.

A second later he felt sickened with himself.
Expected: 5

“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Just like that?” she whispered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“And what’s happened to your eye, Hermione?” “Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?” There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death.

By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

“Oh ... yeah ... right ...” It was an odd moment.

Harry was able to answer that at once.

“Harry, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened — please — ” She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.

“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.

“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.” On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.

They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers.

“Yeah, not bad,” said Harry.

Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco’s mother.

When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.

“Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?” “What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.

Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings — he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?” Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam.

“You may begin...” Harry stared fixedly at the first question.

There was a long minute’s quivering silence, everybody gazing openmouthed into the grounds.

Harry nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.

“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water.

Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.
Expected: 1

“Er — yeah, why not?” Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week.

“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.” “Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once.

Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.

“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron.

Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter — ” “We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged.

“I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.” Fudge still had that strange smile on his face.

Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione’s wand held fast in his trembling hand.

“It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly.

Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

“All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.” On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act normally.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck.

But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole.

“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before.

“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson.

“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly.

Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.

That was definitely a start!” “Can we have another go?

“Who was he tryin’ ter curse?” “Malfoy called Hermione something — it must’ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.” “It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty.

“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice.

“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny.

“I opened it to breathe.” “You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said.

Hagrid was soon yelling, “Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes.

Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury.

He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall.

“Ron’s kept him as a pet!

“Okay, let’s go.” They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.

You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.

Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them.

In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches.

Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face.

I have — with difficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.

George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.

“If we’re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.” At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?” “No,” said Snape softly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house.

Actual: 1

Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Immediately, the world righted itself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Will you pay attention?” Professor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s getting stronger?” “Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named either.

“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said.

“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,” said Malfoy.
Expected: 3

“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said Harry, grinning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him.
Expected: 2

He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.

Actual: 7

Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em.

He had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory.

Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking.

Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“You’re too nosy to live, Potter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry’s eye he looked quickly back at his plate again.
Expected: 5

Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.

“OH!” “Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly.

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It’s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.” “Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets.
Expected: 5

... “Harry\” Ron muttered.
Expected: 4

“I am not the only one who is late, then?

They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He’s a good lad, really... I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a lady friend, actually...” Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss.” That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Hagrid, we can’t — ” “Well tell them what really happened — ” “They can’t kill him — ” “Go!” said Hagrid fiercely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgomath ’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were.
Expected: 5

The pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body.
Expected: 7

“We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.” “But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

That’s what they want.” By “they” he meant Dumbledore.

So that must mean ...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys.

He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s shoulders.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“ What did you say to me, Potter?” “I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her.

“Get ’em all up, Ron.” “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?” “Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Uncle Vernon’s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?” “No, Harry, he has not.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright.

One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it — “TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers.
Expected: 4

“Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing “Rubbish,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered whom they had been beating up tonight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys’, he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!
Expected: 4

He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.

Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.

“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.” “How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Why?” Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, “Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you — ” She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.

If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention.
Expected: 7

“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Hey — CHO!” He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The door closed again and there was silence.
Expected: 5

The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him.

He had a deep, sorrowful voice.

They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall.

Actual: 4

Karkaroff hurried away after Snape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco.
Expected: 2

“Have you seen?

I have never hurt a hair of Harry’s head!

“Bits ...

There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is.

Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “MudbloocL.” The scene changed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch.

Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either.

“Hi,” he said.

Harry raised the sharp black quill and then realized what was missing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.” “What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.

“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.

“You look awful!” “Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Ollivander.
Expected: 7

“Relashio\” Harry shouted, except that no sound came out.

Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.

Hardly anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.” “He wanted to stay here?

...” Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Look at it.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.
Expected: 1

“What?

Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.
Expected: 4

“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer — ” No one seemed to want to.
Expected: 3

“I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair.

“I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word.

“This looks familiar — ” “Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case.

“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr.

Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
Expected: 7

The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.

“She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me.

“Altogether, then ...” Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.

Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just hope he’s working on a plan.” There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.

“See you, Dobby!” “Harry Potter .

Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking.

Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Does this mean you are tired of our duel?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.
Expected: 4

Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.

“P- Petunia?” She raised her head.

Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them.

Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.” “So no pressure, Harry,” said Fred, winking at him.

Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded.

He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm.

Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth.

Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.

He was pale and his eyes were glittering.

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.

Hagrid grunted in amusement.

Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.” Many of the students looked petrified.

“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased.

He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him.

“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?” croaked Kreacher.

“Look at you both!” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall.

Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius.

Is that the best one there is?” Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him.
Expected: 2

“Nearly always right,” she repeated.

“Fine,” said Neville, showing them.

“This is urgent,” he said fiercely.
Expected: 7

Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

You think you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... I’ve been stuck inside for a month.” “How come?” asked Harry, frowning.
Expected: 5

For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed.

“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault.

Harry did not bow.

A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.

Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.

He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me.

The Potions master seemed unable to look away.

Nothing happened.

“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up.
Expected: 5

There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes.

Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor.

Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this.

This seemed to cheer Ron up.

At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge.

After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field.

A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him.

“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.

Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.

“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively.

Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn’t work.

They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.

It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.” “I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said Yaxley.

Harry could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration.

Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing.

Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.

“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously.

“Why not?” said Hermione in surprise.

From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.

There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.

“Sorry?” he said.

“Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over.

In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.

Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.

The rip at the brim opened wide — “GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, supposedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister.

“I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.

“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout anymore: Half the courtyard was listening in.

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch around his neck.

The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends.

“All on his own!

And then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum!
Expected: 7

Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.
Expected: 3

I want you to follow him around the clock.” “Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement.
Expected: 6

Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
Expected: 7

The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door.
Expected: 4

Then he grinned again.

His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward.

Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.
Expected: 7

Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a longhaired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.
Expected: 7

“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated.
Expected: 7

“What an extraordinary moment this is!

“Ron’s just got to have some breakfast.” It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms.
Expected: 5

“You know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.” The bell rang for the end of the lesson.
Expected: 5

When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle.
Expected: 6

How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?” “Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely.

“He knows, man,” said Lee.

“Winners, keepers, Malfoy.

“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
Expected: 7

“Did your mother die of shock?” Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s basket to the floor.

According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.

He was afraid of it.

She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.

“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

“So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?” “Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.
Expected: 4

“Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?” she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“But I shudder to think ...

“Are you sure?” “Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four- poster.

“Go on — ” “You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron.

Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes.
Expected: 7

There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor.
Expected: 5

What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now.
Expected: 7

“Pig snout,” they said and entered.

She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously.

...” “So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape ’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George?
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he’d put himself in for the tournament?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“And you’re not either, are you?” Harry shook his head too.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The room faced the cliff- top garden and the freshly dug grave.
Expected: 7

“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid urgently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Everything went pitch- black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!” “And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable to help himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.

“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.

“Quite right!

“What d’you mean?” he said.

“He knows I’m a Squib!” he finished.

“No ...” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard?” “ You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” Hermione corrected him.

The evil face was now smiling.

But the room was empty.

While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
Expected: 1

It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.

The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.” “ Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed.

Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often.

He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes.

“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles — ” Ron began.

She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.
Expected: 4

Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway.

He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table.

That’s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.” “I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.

If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!” “You?” she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replacing it in front of her.

Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.

Now get to bed.” Harry didn’t move.
Expected: 5

He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze.
Expected: 4

“Ron, what are you staring at?” “Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.

A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry’s throat.

“Very well ...

“But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s thediff— ?” A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head.

“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they?

Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was no good.

The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs.

“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street — ” “I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later.

“What’s going on?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy — however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see ...” Snape was looking murderous.

“Can you fly it?” “No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit.

I’m going to bed.” She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and stood back to admire the effect.
Expected: 5

“Or both,” said Harry.

Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him like that.

Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.

“But — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or something?” There was an odd expression in Hagrid’s unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.

“That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.” She consulted her clipboard.

“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they’ll be rich,” said Fred.

Who can tell me why?” Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up again.

“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I mean next summer, when we — but do you not know?” Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.” Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.

Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.

“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.

“Hi, Angelina.” “Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” “Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, which could only be an improvement.

A few of the Hogwarts students laughed.

Harry looked at the floor.

What an amazing prediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her voice low.

Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.

I wish he was mine, he’s really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord.” Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot.

He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.” “This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning.

You are sixteen years old “Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry.

Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they grudgingly remained in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.

“Just ignore it, Harry.” But Harry couldn’t ignore it.

Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor.

“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?” “No,” said Harry very quietly.

“Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize — ?” “Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her.

“What if it ignited?

Harry had the impression that both had frozen.

Would Malfoy believe what he had seen?

He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak.

“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.

“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll hear us — ” The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden.

But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

“I’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!” But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy.

The only person in there was Viktor Krum.

“Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?” Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.

The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander.

Why was he flying?

“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.

“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you’re bleeding.” “Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve.

Something he didn’t have last time.” “When he was powerful before?” “Yes.” “Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry.

“Myrtle ... what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?” “Oh all sorts,” she said.

Snape had no proof — yet.

Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.
Expected: 4

And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.

“Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?” he asked them unhappily.

An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley.

Percy looked affronted.

Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.
Expected: 7

“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” “Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Anyone tell me what this one is?” He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret ...” Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.
Expected: 4

There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione ’s eye peering through the keyhole.

Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“It’s nothing,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

His red eyes fastened upon Snape ’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze.

Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was.

“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,” said Riddle.

“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed.

Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup.

It was now two o’clock in the morning.

“Hi,” said Harry.

Tell Mummy!” Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his voice.

Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.” He couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You wait,” she said resentfully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“DOBBY!” The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on his coin, and because I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic his.” A blank silence greeted Hermione ’s words.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

There aren’t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy ... it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I didn’t mean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.” The squat ghost of a girl had glided over.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time.” When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.

Actual: 5

My office.” “But sir ...” said Harry, looking up desperately.
Expected: 6

Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.

“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, “we’ aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by a security troll, so — ” “I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny.

Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual.

Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.

I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Really?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose.

Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant — they were off.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls.
Expected: 2

“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“He was out of his mind,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... Wormtail, come turn my chair around.” The servant gave a whimper.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But he is determined that Draco should try first.
Expected: 6

“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens — ” “Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?” said Harry blankly.
Expected: 3

Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white- striped hair.
Expected: 2

Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ” Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer.

Ron’s eyes widened.

“Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.

“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that down the street?’ ” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It is the only thing that might work.
Expected: 7

“All right?” “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” “Well enough.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh — he could tell Dumbledore .
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s father.” Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go into work again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

All clear?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!” “Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I — ” “I said shut up!” Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 2

From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore’s Army.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

You couldn’t help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Don’t you take that tone — ” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart’s desire.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. . . .
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race.

“Where’s the sword?

The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The neat fields had gone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Boys, what good will it do?” Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Why are you disturbing these people?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

We must keep our focus!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.

Actual: 4

He saw a glitter of teeth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“All of it?
Expected: 7

Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Hadn’t he once, long ago, heard of bezoars?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?” “Yes,” said Harry and Ron together, instantly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Tom, what am I going to do?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Oh, Ron, how wonderful!
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

More writing was appearing beneath the first.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You wanted to see them again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I’m their brother!” “But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

. . how you managed to return to us.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You left here early enough.” “Oh ...” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Wear that cloak.” Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,” winked, and departed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was always Harry who ...” Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now\ sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin’s rigid grip.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,” Dumbledore went on, smiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

There was no applause.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He reached out, and as Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry didn’t sleep all night.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...” He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

But he couldn’t remember what came next.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But he was home.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
Expected: 5

Ron’s set was very old and battered.

Actual: 7

Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays.

“Is he okay?” Harry asked.

Harry stopped in the doorway.

“For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff.

Ron’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder.
Expected: 2

He paced up and down in front of the fire.

“Something for you to wear on Tuesday.
Expected: 4

“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy place, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there — ” “I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It must have been a trick of the light.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I was ready.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble.
Expected: 4

They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Anything wrong, Professor?” called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Is he really, Fred?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Snape, headmaster!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said.

One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” “I reckon he’s lost track of time, being on the run,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Are you up yet?” she demanded.
Expected: 1

Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet.

Expected: 2

He had removed them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Hermione, I know you’d have liked him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“But now at last we can speak plainly to each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Blimey, it’s good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?” “Hagrid, you’ve been attacked!” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends...” With what looked like an enormous effort, he smiled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?” Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Someone’s gotta tell Dumbledore!” “Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.” “There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“And Arthur Weasley too!

What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance — ” “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?

A dozen curious people were still watching them.

“But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his tankard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his mirror in a wheezy voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone before.

Not — not really ...

Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.
Expected: 2

Her expression was suspicious.
Expected: 3

Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Look, we can get rid of all this easily.” She pulled out her wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“The old madman attacked me!

Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day.
Expected: 7

How charming — ” “Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

We ’ave all been ’oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me everything.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Be on the watch, Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

There’s something we’ve got to do, and then — ” “You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael Corner.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Seven?
Expected: 5

Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all.

... We’ve been here all night.
Expected: 4

Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old ... Lord Voldemort.

Actual: 6

“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...” Ron snarled.

Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.

An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe.
Expected: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Should Harry wake him?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Yeah ... ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook!
Expected: 7

“It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose — ” The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.” They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry could hear Hermione’s breathing, fast and terrified.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look — ” He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What’s up?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ron!
Expected: 4

“That means you too, Stebbins!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Did he use — his thing?” Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!” He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Why?” said George impatiently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Yeah.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert than usual.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“No, I suppose that’s true.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Follow me,” said Snape.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ” “Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you.

Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

If you’ll come with me.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart - Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Well ... Avery isn’t... He’s in trouble...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Get — away — from — there — ” Percy said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You’re right.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... “He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes still closed tight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...” “It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged- looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina’s voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“W-what are you d-doing?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’ve had a look at it, and it’s actually dried doxy droppings.” This information took the edge off Harry and Ron’s desire for brain stimulants.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Snape had reinstated Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I’ve b-been writing in it, and he’s been w- writing back all year — ” “Ginnyl” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Common blood.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” “Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

... Dad’s too soft with them; he thinks they’re funny.

Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus.

Expected: 2

“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Do you mind if I talk to you?” “No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The crowd didn’t want the veela to go.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They’ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“How are things at your house?” Lily asked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I don’t think Egypt agreed with him.” Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.” “Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind — And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Where are we, exactly?” “Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Yer more famous than him without tryin’.” “Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The elf was doing something very odd.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ” “I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!” Professor McGonagall fumed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“R-Reg?” She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“She can’t complain,” he told Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.” “You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It was little Peter Pettigrew — another of the Potters’ friends.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“You’re just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy — ” “Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry’s face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He even lived with her for a while.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It’s been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

This is money?” “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein’ attacked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Yes,” he breathed back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Hermione recoiled, looking horrified.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Okay.” And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Won’t say no more here.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I would not know...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, “She’s got it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“That’s why we’ve come.” “In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I am no longer your teacher, so I don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Sneaking around on your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?” Harry shrugged.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Reactions not what they were, I see.” “You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Hermione swayed on the spot.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Fred had “rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

She had let me acquire a wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Mad, eh?” “Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” But he broke off.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Who?” demanded Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You never heard her, did you?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

That’s why I’ve been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“There’s a lot of Phlegm around.” “I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard-Muggle relations!
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Hagrid, he killed ...” “Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, “Password?” “Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from behind the crowd.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

No one answered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“No!
Expected: 3

“Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.” She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Do they work?” she asked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“So ... you lot got dates for the ball yet?” “Nope,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I suppose it varies, just like with wizards?” “Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Your mum and dad?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore’s explanation.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.” “But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year.
Expected: 3

This, therefore, they will do.
Expected: 4

Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

How does it work?

... “Er ...

“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

Actual: 6

Please help me — There was no answering voice.
Expected: 2

You can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off.
Expected: 6

“Control your anger, discipline your mind!
Expected: 5

However, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Voldemort had entered the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together again, correct?” Harry nodded.
Expected: 7

“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Mount your brooms ... on my whistle .
Expected: 3

Let’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him.

“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Now, Occlumency.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Was it okay?” But they all refused to say.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” Dumbledore repeated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.” “Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry.

Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear him.

“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey’s office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion.

We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black’s cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader.

A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves.

Harry looked away.
Expected: 4

He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.

They were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.

“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from here.

Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car.

Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, “ Serpensortial” The end of his wand exploded.

There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.

Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ finished, they’d lay off each other, but ...” Hagrid sighed deeply “That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin’ down on the valley.
Expected: 5

“They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It was better like this.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Dumbledore ’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!” “Yeah, it did,” said Harry.

All three of them lifted their right legs.

It was aching fit to burst... “Harry!

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body — say good-bye to your memories!” He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, “Obliviatel” The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb.
Expected: 2

“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.

He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” The giant chuckled.

“I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.” “Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles.

Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.

She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.

The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o’clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass.
Expected: 5

Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was Karkaroff.

“Let the feast begin!” The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink.
Expected: 3

Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.
Expected: 2

... Loser’s Lurgy ...” But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron’s snorts subsided.
Expected: 6

It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt.

The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk.

“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see it at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge.

So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,” said Scrimgeour.

“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him.

Hermione ’s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.

“Why did he try and kill me as a baby?

Bad Dobby\” Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.

But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.

Understand?” “Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” “The floor?” Harry suggested.

Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.

“Now, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games.

The castle was unnaturally silent.

“You cannot help.” He spun around.

“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage.

“Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.

“And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher.

Where have the others got to?” Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry and Ron stared at each other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Let us go.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Not necessarily,” said Lupin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Many people had their eyes shut tight.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak.
Expected: 3

Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light.
Expected: 5

“And in case you’re getting ideas,” he added hastily, “I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood’s as pure as anyone’s, so — ” “I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry fiercely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Why did he come back?

Ron was admiring the cloak.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Yet it couldn’t be that long ago .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He wiped the Marauder’s Map blank again, then set off at a run.
Expected: 3

It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence.

One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion.

“What’s been going on?” said Ron.

‘It’s all right for him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already!

She wasn’t the only one either.

His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions.

A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
Expected: 1

“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Hogwarts\ So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!” Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.

She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Just because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — ” “Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

We’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports.
Expected: 4

“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a quick look at his parents.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he’d better start now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.” “Is that what she was doing?” said Harry as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward himself.
Expected: 5

...
Expected: 6

Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.

If he told Harry he couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated.

The hall light was on.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.
Expected: 7

THE PHOENIX LAMENT “C’mere, Harry ...” “No.” “Yeh can’ stay here, Harry.

“Well, it doesn’t surprise me.

I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry.
Expected: 3

We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us.” “In the end, he turned pretty nasty,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.” “Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Why, yes, I suppose I am,” said Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common room ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away.
Expected: 4

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.
Expected: 1

Harry looked into Dumbledore ’s light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Professor Snape would like a word with you.” Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron’s, and he was egging it on enthusiastically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I thought it was the perfect plan ... a bluff.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup.
Expected: 3

He didn’t argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The Triwizard judge?” “Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

We’ve got to stop seeing each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” “He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it.

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me.
Expected: 2

You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” “And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ” But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
Expected: 6

Neville’s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for instance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He wasn’t looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“You’ll need to stay still,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then he turned a corner into a clearing and — “AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH !
Expected: 3

“Cedric Diggory.” “Oh right,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I’ve got loads.
Expected: 4

Ron!
Expected: 1

It was enough to make anyone panic.” “You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,” sniffed Tonks.
Expected: 7

“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry quickly focused his own.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it ter me for?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d done the right thing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What the — ?” Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

But I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Hi.” “We’ll be in the library, Harry,” said Hermione firmly, and she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Then you needn’t wake up half the castle.” “She ain’t answering, you old besom!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Tell me everything.

“ — and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Why?” He had his answer ready.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?” But to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Nobody was talking.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Neville’s arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking.
Expected: 5

“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope.

“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener.

Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh.
Expected: 2

“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts?

The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them.

“Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Never dreamed they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy.
Expected: 3

I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

His attempt is not working.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

That interview was so brave ...it made me cry.” He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I see.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Are you sure?” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Ron ... maybe you’d better tell Percy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.” “Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He said gruffly, “Look after yourself, Harry,” and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“That’s it, isn’t it, boy?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I found it inside one of the books Mum got me.
Expected: 2

It means a lot.
Expected: 6

He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He strained his ears...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore — ” “So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked Ron, looking thunderstruck.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed?” “Er ... okay,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I know that you were very close to Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...” They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Just in case, you understand me?” Harry nodded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

But we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Forge.” “What’s all this noise?” Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you must.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Mind works the right way, Granger.” Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He will want to stop it at any cost.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were.
Expected: 6

“Imagine that lot loose on the grounds.

“We wanted to ask — ” “I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears.

They had reached the foot of the marble staircase.

Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?” “Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius.

He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling.

“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say — ” “Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.

Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.

“Don’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid?

Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.
Expected: 2

But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

... Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there.

I’m his best mate!

Neither worked.

“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.

He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, “it’s the holidays!
Expected: 3

“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left... Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.” “How do you know all this?” Harry said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.” “At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He slipped past her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off through the castle.
Expected: 4

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.

...
Expected: 3

“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It was a horrible sight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing.
Expected: 3

“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.
Expected: 6

. . but I doubt he will get far.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried.
Expected: 5

Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.

Actual: 6

Then he came back within Harry’s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave.
Expected: 4

Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Partly ’cause they don’ like wizards an’ we didn’ want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an’ all.
Expected: 5

“It happened right in here.

Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again.

...

Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Meanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and seventh years.
Expected: 5

It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides.

What I was, even I do not know ...

“Gives light only to the holder, remember?” “Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” “ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron bitterly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise.
Expected: 3

How can he have done?
Expected: 6

“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.” Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Your father would have been proud,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Potter’s there\ Someone grab him!” Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

A second later, Harry spotted something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

We have much more important matters to discuss.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Ron looked highly delighted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether it worked or not...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

You’ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before.
Expected: 2

The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It’s a famous place.” It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

. . then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know.
Expected: 4

“I don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks ... or pretending to, either, which is just as bad.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs ...” Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Born under — what, sorry?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“And unless you’ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move.

Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.

Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy — better, indeed, than any of the others.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE’S HOUSE.
Expected: 5

The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.” “Potter attacked me, sir — ” “We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

You are not a witch.

“Mr.

“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, sounding disappointed.
Expected: 5

The old woman’s face blanched.
Expected: 5

And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Do you feel safe now?” Harry didn’t answer.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

You would certainly have been that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.” “Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face.
Expected: 7

“He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ” “Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Not like that room you had with the Muggles.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry’s mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency tuition: If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“You haven’t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore a dementor attack.
Expected: 5

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“ — and Ron stabbed it with the sword.” “And ... and it went?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Some of them called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Continue.” “Well, I had a dream,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married.

Actual: 7

. . that was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Robe me,” said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master’s head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He grinned, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“But ... are you sure?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He did not know that you would have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ — ” “But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I owe you one for telling me about the dragons.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Yeah,” panted Cedric.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

It was, Harry knew, the centaurs’ tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You did.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

...” “Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“No, it was only ... Well, I just wanted to say ... Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell...” “Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or something?” “I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

... Harry began to run.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“You’re barely of age, any of you!

Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her.
Expected: 2

“Thank you, Harry.

Where’s that — that thing?
Expected: 3

“You helped me with the egg — we’re square.” “I had help on the egg in the first place,” said Cedric.

He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago.

“ Freshly caught Cornish pixies.” Seamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The silence within the office was absolute.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Potter, is it?” said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry felt very uneasy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A hush fell over the onlookers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The headline of one blared: HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“You will leave from King’s Cross Station on the first of September.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Go with Errol.
Expected: 3

Peeves was not the only thing that was moving.
Expected: 4

There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“This is funny.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote: Ron, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“If you’d just let me — ” “No, Mum.” Rain lashed against the living room window.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Not a scar, no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Best wizard in the world!

The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night.
Expected: 3

Stars were blossoming in the blackness.

“I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’!” At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Their English isn’t too good ... it’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup ... but at least they used sign language another human could recognize.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

But all seems calm.” Snape looked into her eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake!
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Saw his scar.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ” “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Looking for you,” said George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn’t up to much?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie, along the row.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ” “Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...” For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It was nothing personall” “It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Diagon Alley had changed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Ron opened his mouth uncertainly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Enjoying yourselves?” “Oh, yes,” they lied.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s probably the toughest subject there is!” Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going to look after Ron and Ginny?” “Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Let’s give it till break.” History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“What does she see in Krum?” Ron demanded as he and Harry climbed the boys’ stairs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard .
Expected: 4

They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he said in a low voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

. . that was when I was most afraid we would fail.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Bu’ they wouldn’ dare make trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Alohomoral” The window sprang open.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You should all have prepared your recipes now.
Expected: 4

“Please listen to me.” It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I’ve got you a birthday — ” “Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

So it’s you, is it?” “Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I’m trying to sleep.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“How come Fred and George never gave it to me!” said Ron, outraged.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Molly — Arthur — ” said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

His legs sprang together.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!” “Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Weasley, you can partner Finnigan.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

There is an answer!
Expected: 2

Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“ ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Your scar ... has it been hurting at all?” Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Why’s that first year taking pictures?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

No doubt they thought it would amuse you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,” he was telling Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I was getting really worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

True, that would mean an easier job for somebody.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

But that sounds as though they’ve already decided!” “Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant ... A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened... “Harry?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

But they couldn’t.
Expected: 3

With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Flew?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this.

Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.
Expected: 5

It looked very old.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Would you mind leaving while we change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.

“But she may already know ... that excellent clock of hers ...” Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late... Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock.

Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put.

You don’t — touch — Daddy’s — wand — yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst.

“And Harry’s mother.” “But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

NO!” He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin tersely.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry decided on the truth.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?” Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Well — Percy’s got a girlfriend.” Fred dropped a stack of books on George’s head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Come off it,” he said weakly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

And the scene re-formed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“No,” she said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Hoping for some support for his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

She would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Looks like a harp,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr.

A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash.
Expected: 2

“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . poor .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Good, good...” “What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!” Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...” He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We can take Fang with us.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Turn back, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle — ” “Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Aha,” he said vaguely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

... We are still united under the Dark Mark, then!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

We saw Uranus — ha ha ha — ” A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

... He’s worried, and he’s tired.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

How did you survive ?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Right,” said Ron, looking around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

. . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He looked like an old man.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he was positively cute.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” Percy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Neville did not look at him, but stared at his own feet, the color deepening in his face all the while.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Ern!
Expected: 3

Color flooded Fred’s pale face.

The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute writing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Father’s got a lot of influence, you know.
Expected: 3

... Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen.
Expected: 7

“Malfoy’s got detention!

“You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred’s and George’s jokes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” And she looked hopefully toward the door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Got a real treat for yeh today!
Expected: 3

Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“What?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...” Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto its back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Was she all right?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Off you go.” She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“The ring, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

About what finally stopped him?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!” “I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He wished he had eaten less breakfast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I think ... we’re nearly ... yes.” Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you — you’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

We’ll see who’s mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Then he crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“We could lock it in.” “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

... Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa — “and many others did not attempt to find him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play!
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But this raised as many questions as it answered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I just need you to tell me how to do it.” Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Well, now, I couldn’t have that.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime after that was much too late.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Er — ” Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What are you — what’s happened, is everything all right?” “Yeah,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 6

“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!” yelled Bagman.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule.
Expected: 2

Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out: Dear Harry, Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.
Expected: 4

He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.” Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Hermione stepped forward.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

... Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

...” “Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re- being- very- sensitive sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Nothing happened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Not a leaf twitched or shook.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“That’s your problem,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Here ...” Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore ’s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.” “Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

You is killed him!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Look at me!” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There was no sign of any of the other champions.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!” “He looks really grumpy,” said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Griphook flushed angrily.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

With no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy’s stomach — “Harry!
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of “ Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,” but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor’s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What do you want us to do?” Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“My name was down for Eton, you know.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It’s normal to be nervous.” “I’m rubbish,” croaked Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“That family’s trouble.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“You don’t know why you are here?” “No, I don’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Voice carried, didn’ it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

They flattened themselves against the wall and listened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Yes, I’ll see you both later!” He bustled away out of the Hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.” There was a small click and the door swung open.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Regrowing bones is a nasty business.” So was taking the Skele-Gro.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“No thanks,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“That’s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.” “Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) — if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“My God — Diggory!” it whispered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“See you, then ...” The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Love from Hermione.’ ” “Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He kept his eyes fixed on the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn’t go on.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Flint’s nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?” Dobby bowed his head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

No!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.” She left the room, slamming the door behind her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t hear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Quick.” People’s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

. .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Buckbeak’s appeal — it’s set for the sixth.” “That’s the day we finish our exams,” said Hermione, still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Yeah ... it could be.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I wonder what he’s up to?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was plain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

And what about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

His heart was still hammering very fast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell — ” “Shh!” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry’s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand this any better than he did.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Why did he have to go red now?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I was gifted, I was brilliant.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“But — ” “Shh!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.” A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“ Potterwatch , didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?” “Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I think I did, but I closed my eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...” “Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey ...” “Oh, very well,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard ’s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.” “But — ” Hermione began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Instead, he turned to his house-elf.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The orphanage ...” Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“But that doesn’t mean much.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I’ve been checking every day.

“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, lowering his wand.

“You know what he’s like.

The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two.

Just because I told her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in disbelief.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He was an Unspeakable — he worked in the Department of Mysteries!” They looked at one another for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back toward her, closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?” “What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain’s tentacles had wrapped around him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a week.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Trust me,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d done it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

School champion!” He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, “Yeh know what I’d love, Harry?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was gone: Someone had cut him free.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Sirius “Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked in a low voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Why don’t you join us in our compartment?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Any ideas?” muttered Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I would have died before I betrayed them.” And at long last, Harry believed him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“But you will fetch it for me first, Black... You think you have felt pain thus far?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Everyone here?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Or our son, Draco?” “How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 4

He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“He’s not going,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Thirteen long years ...
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

. . you’d think I’d said something terrible.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Angry?” Harry was feeling really annoyed now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s neck stand up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Romilda?” he repeated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, “leave now, please!” There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Not in the house.” Uncle Vernon grunted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

His heart shot upward into his throat.

The other ingredients were easy.

“I didn’t need to use it before we got in the forest.

However, he did let drop certain snippets.
Expected: 7

“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

And you, George?” The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I saw that.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

. . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

We could’ve had ages ... months ... years maybe.
Expected: 6

“Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented.
Expected: 7

We should probably get out into the garden so we’re ready.
Expected: 5

He gritted his teeth and knocked.
Expected: 2

However, her troubles were far from over.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Hermione looked at him bleakly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do the task.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“But what does it matter?” he said softly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

They had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

And Master Regulus said ... he said ...” The old elf rocked faster than ever.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry’s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly broad-minded when he was younger!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Left here, Harry.” They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Was there something you wanted to tell us?” Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Have you ...” he began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!” “You will,” said Dumbledore sadly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

There was nothing else for it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I reckon we can just wait here, you know.
Expected: 4

...
Expected: 2

“You think you’re funny,” she said coldly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home.
Expected: 6

You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?” Harry tried to force Goyle ’s dull face into a look of concern.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Little Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said Harry, his throat dry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

So when Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort — Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and sent to Azkaban...” She gazed at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

As Harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Look this way, Harry!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,” he said in his gloomy voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Guess what?” he added, turning to Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.” “Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“If we hurried, we could go down and see him.
Expected: 3

“The skull ... danger in your path, my dear.
Expected: 3

“Ten Galleons to me!
Expected: 3

“If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

What d’you — ?” began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.” “I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named, remember?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Can you introduce me?” Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.” “You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!” “Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies.
Expected: 3

In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.
Expected: 7

...
Expected: 7

Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, “Arthur, is that you?” “Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He had not told Ron, Hermione, or anyone else what the prophecy had contained.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

This is the second time in a week.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He hadn’t thought of that.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Good-bye,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Where are we going?” “Bit further,” said Hagrid over his shoulder.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Damn leg,” he said furiously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I must remember to tell Lucius.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“But Percy’d better not see us.” Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish.
Expected: 2

Malfoy had seen the dragon.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had.
Expected: 3

The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He had hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Potter!
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“OH NO YOU DONT, LADDIE!” Harry spun around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“What did you come after me for, then?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.” “I won’t,” said Ron into his hands.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

... Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the covers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Well get it,” said Fred at once.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was as bright as a unicorn.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

. . Whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape ... never ... “What are you doing, Potter?” said Snape coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It’s the best chance we’ve got.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You’ve had enough for one night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I’ve got a meeting with him.
Expected: 6

“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“She’s just outside the door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a Mudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn’t seem to have realized what had happened.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, “all the time.” “Excellent,” said Aunt Marge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Dead).” “Harry, let go of him,” he heard Fudge’s voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric’s limp body, but Harry wouldn’t let him go.

“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor McGonagall heavily.

“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“No, no, no.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I mean ... you know ...” She looked carefully around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,” he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The cut had turned a nasty shade of green.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Twycross did not seem discouraged.
Expected: 6

“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry squinted at them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I know,” said Ron in a low voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this past week.” Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table.
Expected: 6

This was the worst he had ever felt.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” she whispered, “there ... in the trees, sir.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was skirting the edge of the forest now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Three turns?
Expected: 3

“Dumbledore’s Army.
Expected: 7

Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Yes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Personally, I try and treat him like any other student.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and quietly toward the stairs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

What do you think?” Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

You know.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?” “What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, “What is it this time, Miss Granger?” “I’ve already read chapter two,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“There’s a difference.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do, he had no idea.
Expected: 6

He whirled around.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

It snapped loudly again.
Expected: 3

I knew he’d be back for me!

“Ron,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s seeing Michael, she knew you’d take it badly.

Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying.
Expected: 7

“I think I know what this means — open this one first!” Harry ripped off the brown packaging.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“How did you know — ?” “Oh, just your expression,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“But I don’t know what it means.
Expected: 2

True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W.
Expected: 4

Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The other was Neville Longbottom.” “But then .
Expected: 5

“Yeah ...” Face dry, Harry looked up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“This little beauty’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school.” “You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment.

The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Expected: 2

... Let the police come, he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ... Voldemort raised his wand.

“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.

Actual: 6

“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!” “What are they shouting about?
Expected: 4

“All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus.

He questioned me.

They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“No — he wouldn’t,” she said.
Expected: 1

I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I’m off to try and find the Bloody Baron...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Remember that, Grawpy?” But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.

It was coming — as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.

“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.

In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl.

This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.

Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.

Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office.

“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard.

The door downstairs crashed open.

Five points from Gryffindor!” “But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in detention again — ” “What’s this, Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry.

Frank knew at once what was going on.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it.
Expected: 2

He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it.
Expected: 3

“Aha!” he said.
Expected: 4

We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that.

“He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them — ” “That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile.

It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high.

Oh the shame, the shame!” She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.

I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive.

Harry stared.

At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water’s edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.

Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“In a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared.” Harry said nothing.
Expected: 5

“Lord, is it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and — ” “Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry.
Expected: 7

“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,” Harry put in.
Expected: 7

“Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.” Harry couldn’t believe it.
Expected: 6

“Got — got what?” she said with a little start.
Expected: 7

“You see it all the time with dogs.

“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.
Expected: 2

It’ll happen anyway — ” “No — ” Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling.

Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold.

“Shut it,” growled Moody.

You should see Sloper and Kirke, they’re pathetic, even worse than I am.” He heaved a great sigh.

“Simply splendid to see you, old boy — “Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry’s hand in turn.

“I was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid .
Expected: 5

Harry felt himself going red in the face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What?” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

All three of them hesitated outside the door.
Expected: 5

“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.
Expected: 3

She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron’s table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I know I am,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
Expected: 1

“I didn’t mean — I just forgot ...” “Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes.
Expected: 4

“Quidditch ... the last match of the ...” “Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth.
Expected: 6

Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!” “Yes, I can see that,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm.

“ Name ... Harry Potter.

If I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how much you’ve learned.

The other Beater, Bole, was closing in.

You don’t know what it’s like here.

He wished he hadn’t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.

Hedwig had been absent for two nights now.
Expected: 3

“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third day.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.” “And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
Expected: 6

“Harry’s arrived.” “Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger hair.

“Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.

She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion.

As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement...

“My sister.

Seven hundred galleons!

“Professor, is there anything — er — wrong?” “Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion.

The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat.
Expected: 2

“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I’m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, “Where were you?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I’ll just — ” He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.
Expected: 2

“You’re late.” “Sorry,” said Harry nervously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we’ve ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags.
Expected: 3

“He was my mum and dad’s best friend.

“I already know.” “You know?

Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.
Expected: 2

So — everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?” Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very halfheartedly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

She wouldn’t know how!
Expected: 4

“Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
Expected: 1

“I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.” Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes.

“Where ’d you get that?” “Nicked it,” said James casually.
Expected: 5

“But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes, indeed ...” Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

At last Dumbledore straightened up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I didn’t beg!” “I saw his reply.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He was not at home.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I don’ know why that’d be...” said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermione’s — she’s got me a homework planner — ” Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s handwriting on it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“It’s here — just here — yes!” They pushed the door open.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
Expected: 4

Just — ” But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Better not risk it.” “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate?
Expected: 3

“We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.” “But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think.
Expected: 4

There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s throat.
Expected: 6

“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating himself and Luna.
Expected: 6

“What are you up to?” “Nothing,” shrugged Neville.

When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter.

Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.” Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.

“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin.

“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?” Draco Malfoy laughed.

“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I hope it tastes better than this stuff.

He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.

“Headaches?

What if she’s still there?” Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight.
Expected: 2

They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch.

“If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.

“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry.

“Careful!” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 5

There was a commotion.

Harry nodded.
Expected: 5

When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself?
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Harry, where’s Hedwig?” “She ... she got hit,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Just don’t sell it.” “Of course not ... sir.” Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.
Expected: 6

“What good’ll that do?
Expected: 1

“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?” “He can’t have,” said Ron.
Expected: 7

It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry — ” “ — you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.
Expected: 4

Henceforth, stay away from this place.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,” whispered George.
Expected: 2

He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.

Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying.

The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches.

“And neither do I.” “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I was sort of right.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it.
Expected: 5

There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously, flexing his claws.
Expected: 3

“Snatchers,” said Ron.
Expected: 7

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry’s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.

“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark — ” “Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly.

There’s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy’s got.” “I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said Harry flatly.
Expected: 3

“He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I mean, that someone threw you out of the room.” To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.

“But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell — ” “NOW!” yelled Harry.

“You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.” They looked at each other, long and hard.

After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.

They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.

“But they said you’d left.

Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.

Terribly distressed, you know.

“You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.

Harry looked at him curiously.

“Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?” “I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively.

Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself.

He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it.

“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.

“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her.

To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.

“It’s empty now — come on!” They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.

“You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast!

I can’t believe it ...

Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?” Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.

Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s.

Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.

“You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.” “Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.” The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else.

Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.

So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.

Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He had known all along that he wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E. It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be.

The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.

Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.

For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.

Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.

He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming — There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.

“So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” “You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose?

What about you, Weasley?” Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.

The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound... “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield.

Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime.

“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.

As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup.

“Punishment?” “I broke the law!” Harry said.

The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know.

“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat.

Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through.

“But after talking to Snuffles ...” “But he’s all for it!” said Harry.

“I’m going, I’m going!” And with another loud crack, he vanished.

“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said Ron fearfully.

Expected: 3

Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.
Expected: 3

But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

An’ you!” Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback.

“We’ve still got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me... Here.” He held out his book.

Am I allowed to look after my patients now?” She was in a very bad mood.

“I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things.” Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s heart began to race.

“Enough.” And the laughter died at once.

A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.

“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness.

“He wouldn’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know.

“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 6

... And the scene changed.

Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities.

Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney.

Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.

On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.

His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.

He was furious they’d come onto the grounds.

Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up.

“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.
Expected: 4

There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.

Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.

Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.

“Get out of the way, we’re leaving.” Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer.

When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna.

“Right,” said George briskly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?” “Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet.

“Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others — ” “I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent.

But it was just a broom cupboard then...” “Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.

“And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.” But Frank did not leave.

There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.

It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.

Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked.

Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see.

“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too.

Dad can usually get tickets from work.” This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.

He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.

Perhaps in here?” Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks.

“This is our practice time!

Even so, he wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her.

It won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.” “And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.

“Leave Scabbers alone.” The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room.

“Gone to curl his hair, more like.” They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.

“I did not ask for information.

Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.
Expected: 3

Give me your glasses, quick!” He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, “Imperviusl” “There!” she said, handing them back to Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Harry — what’s up?” For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.
Expected: 4

“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!” “You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.

“Is it?

The hall fell silent.

Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend.

My scar hurt again.

She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.

And if I remember rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving - people-thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or” — he rounded on Ron — “when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk — ” “I never said I had a problem!” said Ron heatedly.

A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.

Scars can come in handy.

“Dad?” They just looked at him, smiling.

“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me again.

These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.

A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a promise of a feast.

Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air.

“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your turn, Potter.

As he reached the pavement, Harry looked around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.” “How can he think that?” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5

The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face.

“We need more height... Give it another quarter of a mile!” Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps.

I have, as we both know, limited time.

“If he really is a rat, it won’t hurt him.” Ron hesitated.

Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?” “Hey — Harry!” “Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough.
Expected: 4

“No,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5

Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom .
Expected: 4

Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.
Expected: 2

Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.

Ron and Hermione ’s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached.

Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him.

The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken.
Expected: 6

The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots.

“Ill go now.” “Excellent,” said Dumbledore.

“Like father, like son, Potter!

“Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” And he scooted off.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Hermione often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.

“Yes, Tonks is with him — at her mother’s — ” Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen.

Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort.

At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

In the falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills... “This is bizarre!” Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support...

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.

Narcissa threw back her hood.

As half the class lumbered up to Snape ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed- up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.

“See you, Myrtle ... thanks for your help.” “ ’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap.

“It happens, young man, it happens!

“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly.

I can see ’is scar!” “Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...” Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub.

“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron.

This reminded Harry of something.

“You heard me.

It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed down to Hagrid’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold.
Expected: 5

“I’m sorry ...

“Help yourself,” said Harry.

“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon.

“Er ... that’d be ... er ... hang on — ‘er’!

The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire.

“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told Harry ruefully.
Expected: 5

But ... “Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do.

He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.
Expected: 6

“ ‘It’s your own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ” They went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not improved by Hermione’s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in T ransfiguration .
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!” But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
Expected: 6

“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,” said Ron dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had been broken into.” Harry was glad Ron took this view.

“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry.

“You what?” said Harry.

Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.

They knew that old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.

“Ahem — twenty minutes to go,” said Professor Tofty.

The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.

Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.

Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons.
Expected: 3

“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able to get it and — ” “Harry, we mustn’t be seen!” “How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione fiercely.
Expected: 3

“Of course there are,” said Ron.

The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters’ laughter.

... “Harry,” sobbed Hagrid.
Expected: 7

Harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
Expected: 3

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway.

“Not even Fred and George.

Harry gaped after her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Anyway ... good luck, Ronald!” She drifted away.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.” Harry took the map and grinned.

“... kill ... time to kill ...” The voice was growing fainter.

“Gryffindor penalty!” And Angelina scored.

“Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins?” “Yes,” said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more.

You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.

“Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it.

“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5

With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts.
Expected: 6

Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The lightning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the dementors ... “What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I know it’s hard.

“I was just thinking of making one.” “All right,” said Harry awkwardly.

“Run.

“Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said Peeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear.
Expected: 2

There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

You must see that Professor Snape’s version of events is far more convincing than yours.” “He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.
Expected: 6

“A bit more than that ... and a bit more ... that’s the ticket.” Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie.
Expected: 3

Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.” “Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor McGonagall into Luna’s megaphone.
Expected: 6

He didn’t say anything.

One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion.

Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by.

Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.

Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed.

Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won’t answer.

“We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry.
Expected: 3

“There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak.

Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

“You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s cleaning.” Harry left through the back door.

Expected: 4

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

This time she did not lead him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,” Hagrid continued in a low voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.
Expected: 6

“Ill go and meet them.

“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.

They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone.

He kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.

“However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale — ” But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns ’s every word.

Harry looked up at the giant.

“It’s us.

“Looks like we’ll have to split up,” said Tonics briskly, looking around for empty chairs.

Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly.
Expected: 7

“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.” Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But that doesn’t mean he can’t still spot the real thing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.

Can’t we call him You-Know-Who — please?” “Dumbledore said fear of a name — ” began Harry.

Actual: 6

Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I don’t think I’d have minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like dancing very much.” She retreated behind The Quibbler again.

Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr. Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry.

“I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark.
Expected: 7

“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.
Expected: 3

Will you let me share my knowledge with your students?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“No, I haven’t,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky.
Expected: 4

There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.

“Lily Evans.

He had to know. . . . And there were the dementors.
Expected: 3

“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And I can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren’t — ” “But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge.
Expected: 5

“Because she was crying,” Harry continued heavily.
Expected: 5

How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort?
Expected: 5

“What things?” “Those horse — ” Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual.

By the afternoon, though, he had no choice.
Expected: 1

Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“You just better had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!” “We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at Hermione.
Expected: 3

The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.

Actual: 7

“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione.

They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall.

Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance — Gringotts Bank.

“See!

Well, let’s get going, then, George.” “What are you two up to?” asked Ron.
Expected: 6

The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn’t enjoyable.

“You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf.

“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.

“All right, I’ll spit it out.

The color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry watched.

“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.

A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock.
Expected: 3

Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.

“I know you’ll be brilliant!” Ron ignored her.

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him.

It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he’d put it on.

“Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it?

After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy.

“One ... two ... three ...” Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel.

Miss Granger, three turns should do it.

“You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse.

Drafty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies.
Expected: 4

...” “And what did you say?” Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk.
Expected: 4

He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family.

KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!

“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return?

“I met him!” growled Hagrid.

“If you said I could go — ” “But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer.

The Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.” Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.

“Gravy, Fleur?” In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.

“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.

Justin actually told him he’d been down for Eton.

And then came a new sound — Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor — someone was moving downstairs.

“You aren’t still thinking of leaving?” “Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
Expected: 7

As they turned the corner, Harry looked back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak.
Expected: 3

He opened his eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and deposited them in the basin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.
Expected: 7

In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not without reason — of robbing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alas tor with the luggage, look ...” A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
Expected: 5

You know,” Ron grimaced, “his girlfriend.

Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.

He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.
Expected: 3

Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum.
Expected: 4

“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike.
Expected: 4

“Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose?” “No,” said Tonks.

We’ll tie for it.” Cedric stared at Harry.

“It makes it formal and it gives him authority.

I ask you to tell us what happened.” The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note.

Or you?” “Definitely not.” “Oh.” Harry stared into the fire.

“In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism.

“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation.

She’s been talking about you all summer.” “Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother’s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word.

I hope that it is true.

January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather.

“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.

"... there were hundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were there — ” “But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight.

The Dursleys got into bed.

With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter.

Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them.

I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them.

Hey, Harry!” Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.

She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone.

He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.

Wood had obviously got the message.

“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.” “I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice shaking with anger.

“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly crafty.

Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited.

Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.

“Cho!” Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.

“Watch your frog, it’s escaping.” Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Acciol ” — and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.

“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ” “I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly.

“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand and setting off.

“Hurry up, you three,” she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her.

Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about.

They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake.

He was thinking back to the person he’d seen on the other bank of the lake.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“That was the one I burped slugs all over.
Expected: 2

“But — ” “Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?” Hermione snapped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?” Ron blinked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics ... let’s go.
Expected: 4

“I’m his second, who’s yours?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Fine, go then!” Harry bellowed at the empty frame.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

She’ll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it’s still July.” “You don’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her?” Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.

“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

. . And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was still drinking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?” Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.
Expected: 6

The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar.

“What if you get it wrong?” “Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age.

“Potter, you need to be careful.” Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her.

“Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list!

“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to.

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do.
Expected: 7

He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening; Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.
Expected: 5

“Forget I said it!

Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again.

“I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty,” said Hagrid.

“As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry.

“Oh, look,” said Flint.

Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later.

If he gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord Voldemort?
Expected: 3

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.” “Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I really couldn’t care less.” She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment.

It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

His walk instantly became something more like a strut.

Kreacher and Regulus ’s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line.
Expected: 7

His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear!” “Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons.
Expected: 3

He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down.

“Stop!

Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand, and muttering, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He stopped in his tracks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I expect that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.” “Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done.
Expected: 7

Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:  Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He didn’t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn’t see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?” “Er,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school — ?” “Oh, Harry ... not that again ...” “Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!” “What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them.

Actual: 3

You can’t just Apparate in here.

For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You know what — we should make up with Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.
Expected: 2

Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” It was Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione ’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry asked her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Is it Harry Potter?” “I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The longer he looked, the more there was to see.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

... And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

Now he’d done it.

Actual: 5

All around them, people were asking one another the same question: “How did he get in?” “Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw a few feet away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I returned two hours later.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I’m not the only one who’s getting worried.” He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.

Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?

He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy ’s steed’s mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt.

The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you.

There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too.
Expected: 5

“I knew it,” he murmured.
Expected: 1

Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.

Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

Hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.

For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.

When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry’s window.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was not Sirius, but Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

. . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Read it!
Expected: 7

“It’s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.” He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snow-flecked eyebrows.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Nothing,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“How the ruddy hell — ?” “Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And then ... it was a little while later .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Did you have a good Christmas?” “Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — ” “I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“He really knows me now, watch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Have you got him?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Yeah, there’s a burn on this table,” said Ron, pointing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“You sleep with this under your pillow?” But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

On the count of three, then.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was much warmer in here.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“That tree did more damage to us than we — ” Ron blurted out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry’s insides had become glacial.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

LETTIN’ HIM!” Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Never try to understand the students.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

And that wasn’t all.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He didn’t think so, somehow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I’ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors.
Expected: 3

“He’s not an idiot.
Expected: 4

“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“How were the runes?” said Ron, yawning and stretching.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

...” There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hermione ’s breathing was shallow and uneven.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry told them what he’d heard.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.” “Tell him what?” Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I know prefects can’t dock points, Weasel King,” sneered Malfoy; Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...” Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

All right, Harry, Hermione?” “I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.” “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Sure?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I do not think that it is of great importance.” “Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“But I wasn’t expecting this many of you!” “Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Mind you, she’s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn’t want to admit it — ” “Of course she doesn’t,” said Hermione sharply, looking up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Wha’s made yeh say tha’?” “I saw it happen.” “Yeh couldn’ have.” “I saw it, Hagrid.” Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It took a long while to get started next morning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?” “Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“It may even be unique.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

How did you sustain those injuries?” Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry’s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Just seen him!
Expected: 7

The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was.

It’s about to go!” “He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

’ ” “Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yes, of course I have.” “Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for two exams at once?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

There’s no blocking it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Now.” Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.” He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Morfin made to get out of his armchair.
Expected: 6

...
Expected: 4

Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

When he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry — ” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point .
Expected: 4

... You’ll be in such trouble.
Expected: 6

“Sir — Professor Dumbledore?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Here.

They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It’s nothing, really, I’d just rather — ” Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He considered Harry for a moment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night.

They had found Gryffindor’s sword.
Expected: 7

There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the dementors — and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
Expected: 1

Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.
Expected: 1

Where have you been?
Expected: 2

“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now.

“I found her holding one, Ludo.
Expected: 4

“I think there is a Dudley in there.” Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?
Expected: 7

Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified.

Ron kicked him.

Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn’t need them — he took them off and called, “Are you two okay?” Goyle’s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.

“Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me.

“Master, we crave to know .

“I don’t want to fight anymore!” “I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke.

Highly convenient, highly convenient ... so it’s just your word and no witnesses...” “I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court.
Expected: 5

Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping servility looked convincing.

He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.
Expected: 7

Nothing’s about to attack me.” A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron.

I was often rather sharp with him.

Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.

Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips.

And dangerous, very dangerous.

Could Dumbledore have let such things happen?

I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry.

They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.

Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.

Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph.

“Harry?” Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood.

Once there they looked back — Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing.

“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term?

“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed shortcuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind.

“Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, wasn’t she?

“Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again.

Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.

“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.

“Just thinking about the holidays.” “Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron.

One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.

Actual: 7

Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.

Actual: 5

That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity?

“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Glad!

He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy.

With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.

“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly.

“Migh’ be,” he said evasively.

“Oh, and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal, it’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ” Harry’s stomach turned over.

“How do you know, Professor?” “Because he was doing detention with me.

For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.

Do you feel brave, Harry Potter?

Dumbledore went on, “This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely.

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

You don’t have to do the essay.” “Oh no,” said Hermione, looking very disappointed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

And last night — ” Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” “Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt quietly.

“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Who’d have thought it?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He can’t go giving students stuff like this — ” “That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said Ron.
Expected: 3

Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves?
Expected: 4

Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables.

Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy.

“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,” said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses.

The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“This is brilliant!” And he and Harry led the way into the shop.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

What are we supposed to do?” But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?” “I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s reaction.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry.

However, he looked good-natured.

Slytherin won, though narrowly.

“She stands out.

Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly.

“Expecto patronum).” “Expecto patronum,” Harry repeated under his breath, “expecto patronum.” “Concentrating hard on your happy memory?” “Oh — yeah — ” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride.
Expected: 3

“But I still want to talk to you.” Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“What about Ron, though?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands!

“That will do,” he said sharply.
Expected: 2

“Yeah ...

“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.

He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him.
Expected: 5

Someone watching us.
Expected: 7

During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I said, what’s in the Department of Mysteries, sir?” Harry said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without looking at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But then — “Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?” squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father’s arm.
Expected: 3

The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione ’s part.

He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died.

“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!” “I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on yourself.

Expected: 4

Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands.
Expected: 7

... “Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.

Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5

No, listen!

“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak — ” “You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“I mean, everyone hates him — ” “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” Harry spun around.
Expected: 2

“What’s happened?” Harry said.
Expected: 5

He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, away from the Dursleys.

The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles.

“Did someone call?” “I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.

As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool.
Expected: 5

“They should be all right.

“It woke me up, it hurt so badly.” Dumbledore merely looked at him.

Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.

“My only son ... my only son ...” “You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly.

“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“And isn’t Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

When she spoke, her voice quivered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

She didn’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

LEAVE THE BIRD!
Expected: 2

As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg.
Expected: 3

“iVo!” growled Hagrid.
Expected: 2

“No, no ... best we know where you are.

“Drink it before it gets cold, won’t you?

Everyone stopped talking to watch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

That’s what’s normal for wizards.” Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word.
Expected: 4

“Midnight all right?
Expected: 1

“You haven’t got the nerve or the ability — ” “Incarc — ” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.

She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away.

“Harry?

Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain.

But why have you not returned to Divination?

He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Here — and here — ” “Come and look at this!” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

There’s nothing you can do about Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn — ” “Correct.

There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you.

“They’re Imperiused,” he added, in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” He opened the crate.

How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?

“Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate.

“Well ...

Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore’s office.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Surely — surely — they weren’t about to be punished?
Expected: 2

“I care,” said Harry.
Expected: 6

Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Would Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry?
Expected: 6

“It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ” “ — and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

She’s been dying to hear ...” Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” He ignored Hermione ’s hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They have been growing restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Why?” “I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“What are they like?” “Horrible — well, not all of them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” Ron said, stopping mid- sentence at the look on Harry’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Snape, however, remained standing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“It made all the difference in the world, Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Are you all right?” “It’s okay, everything’s fine.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends.

“Up you go, Macmillan.

“Me dad’s a Muggle.

Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.
Expected: 7

“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!” “Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a break,” said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.
Expected: 4

...
Expected: 6

“Father’s not very happy about my injury — ” “Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn’t noticed he was dead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Right — earmuffs on.” Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

... Wormy was here .
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

And Snape ’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.” “Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Protegol” Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry — and suddenly Harry’s mind was teeming with memories that were not his — a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

with only an “Acceptable,” Harry watched him without really listening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it.” “So what?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

. . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?” Dobby asked tentatively.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

St-stop it!” “I’m not doing anything!
Expected: 5

What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Just thinking ...” she said, still frowning at the rain- washed window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a hope of finding me here.

Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning.
Expected: 5

I suppose he knows about all this?” “Of course he knows.
Expected: 3

“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You can’t wait to join You- Know- Who, can you?” He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“We should all be in position at eight o’clock.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...” But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione ’s face that she was thinking what he was thinking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He was sitting there wearin’ Karkus ’s helmet, leerin’ at us as we got nearer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

But you’re still here, aren’t you?” Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.” “It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Was it pity?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Neither of you understands Potter as I do.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped was an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
Expected: 1

It’s infallible.
Expected: 7

Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him.
Expected: 4

“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.” Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh.

“Do you mean to tell me,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, “that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?” “Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr. Weasley imploringly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Weird).” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Time’s wearing on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

. . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

What happened?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“He was right in Voldemort’s inner circle — ” “ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected Ron angrily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.

Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets.

“Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad you’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he’s bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake...” He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby.
Expected: 5

“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I’d blow meself up before I set foot in that place.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” “I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Reparo\” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave of her wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Ginny was shaking like mad, though.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry did not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” He swallowed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

And out fell — a book.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Alecto?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“No!” said Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh please.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I wanted to escape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” Harry could have kicked him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes — Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast.

...

They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues.

There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual.
Expected: 2

“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny.
Expected: 5

Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can’t feel it!

Expected: 3

“I don’t know.
Expected: 2

“Oh, are we?” said George.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding.
Expected: 7

“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year.
Expected: 2

“Yeah,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Snape ’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“You can kip under that,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Password?” she said as they approached.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

But — I didn’t realize — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?” Ron shook his head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Snape’s,” said Harry.
Expected: 1

“But you did!” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Dumbledore will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to Harry’s story.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Then he said, “I hate being poor.” Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yes, it’s a minute off.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Now you can give that graffitied copy back.” “Are you mad?” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

. . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now ... he could see daylight above him.
Expected: 4

“I have never been much of a potion- brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Hi, Neville.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Fawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled on Dumbledore ’s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight embrace.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement.
Expected: 3

“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.

He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.

I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts.

“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Ha!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Were you?” said Professor McGonagall haughtily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Neville followed him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He heard the door close and looked up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!” She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I didn’t mean “WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I — ” “HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Some people reckon — ” Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, “some people reckon he’d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.” Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex- journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione’s least favorite people in the world.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Hermionel” “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Take another ten points,” said Professor Sprout.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Curses.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth.

Nous Vavons perdue — ” “Er — what?” said Ron.
Expected: 4

“Cough up, everyone, I haven’t got enough gold for all of these...” Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I think it’s a warning ... it means danger’s coming.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first.

“Why — what — oh, Hagrid\” “I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless!” “Harmless!” said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Are you quite sure, dear?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He had barely read them when the words vanished again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He saw Ron — and then he saw Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

I’ll show you, look ...” He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician.

A beam of wandlight fell into his face and Grey back laughed.

“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate.

Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently.

“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look really suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table.
Expected: 5

“It’s that Mudblood!

A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn’t seem to be working.

He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it... but he wasn’t going to play along.
Expected: 4

Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?” “Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.” “Yeah ... maybe,” said Harry.

“A branch of — ?” “Everlasting fire,” said Hermione irritably, “you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!” “Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ” “And what did Karkus say?” asked Harry eagerly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It did not contain birthday greetings.

He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“D-did I?
Expected: 2

His insides were burning with guilt.
Expected: 2

The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Then he heard footsteps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Never ... never ever ...” Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.
Expected: 2

“What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Fred and George gave them to me!
Expected: 6

“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry.
Expected: 2

Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid ’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.
Expected: 4

Neither of them really knew what to say.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Who were you talking to?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!” “I understand,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” “ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I can see them too.” “Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail’s mouth.
Expected: 7

“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty points up,” Wood told Harry constantly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.” “What are you working on?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“The question is, how.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.
Expected: 4

Mind, the dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.” “But you were innocent!” said Hermione.

“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Expected: 6

“You have done well to tell me this,” said Harry.

He is sending in regular owls with instructions.

“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says Skeeter.

Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up at Harry.

Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift.
Expected: 7

We had ter leg it an’ we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.” “Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly.

Black’s dead.

Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.

“Search the tent!” said another voice.

I’ve got gold.” “Not gold,” said Griphook.

“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne.
Expected: 6

Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Harry, do you know any of these men?” “No,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Phone the police, Vernon!
Expected: 5

He looked up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” Ron grabbed the binoculars.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

You actually fainted?” Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I expect I was hopeless, was I?” “He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,” Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Had he overheard them?
Expected: 4

“Ouch!

The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Mars is bright tonight.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

But yeh will be.” Harry said nothing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

. . what, excuse me?” “Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

White-hot anger leapt inside him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I’ll take him from here...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Why isn’t this place full of ghosts?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“So did I,” said Cedric.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“And, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, don’t you?” “I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place.
Expected: 6

Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.

Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer’s night, mark you.

They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.

Hagrid can’t have left, can he?” “I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna.

The door flew open at once.

“I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again.

Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead.

Harry didn’t move.
Expected: 1

Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

But he is a bit mad, yes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Dumbledore stopped talking.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I — I’ve got to go to the library, got to get some work done.” After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again.
Expected: 3

“Maybe they need an interpreter.” “Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” Ron asked Hermione.

Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.

It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron.

“We must be miles under the school,” she said.

What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?

There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last.

Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay’ Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” “What are you talking about?” “One of those superstitions, isn’t it?

The empty goblet was still smoking.

At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit.

I’ll — ” “Argus'.” Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers.

“Y-you cast that doe?” “What?

“I would not expect you to understand,” he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been.

Actual: 5

I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you were — ” The air exploded.

“My dear boy .

Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.

“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.

I daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.” “Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
Expected: 1

Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.
Expected: 5

One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him.

The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and solidified in his chest.

“Bet you five Galleons the next one dies.

“Why?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.

There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail.

Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but Harry had not even started.
Expected: 5

“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked excited.
Expected: 3

There was no point beating around the bush.

“It’s not over yet,” said Fred.
Expected: 3

“I bet there aren’t many living people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll be fascinating!” “Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Can’t ... can’t you see them?” “See what?” “Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?” Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you!” They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.
Expected: 7

“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
Expected: 3

... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon?

Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding- bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.

“Eat,” he repeated.
Expected: 3

“You do not understand fine distinctions.
Expected: 5

If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.” Harry nodded and sighed.

But he didn’t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.

“Welcome,” it said.

When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of each other), Ron’s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Take this Portkey, Harry.” He held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed his hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent.
Expected: 5

“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?” Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him.

He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.

Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s.

Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again.

That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains.

They were over the lake — the castle was right ahead — Ron put his foot down.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!” “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.

He looked nervous.

“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffly.

Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.

“My dear friends,” he said mournfully.

“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin ’s face.

The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.

But Snape was beside himself.

Cedric was pacing up and down.

With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.

He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.
Expected: 6

He had come back to the edge of the maze.

“Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” “Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.

Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t.

And don’t let James wind you up.” “What if I’m in Slytherin?” The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.

Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,” suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior.

“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table.

Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher.

“We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door — ” “Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, “let’s go.

Harry looked sideways at Hermione.

Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.” He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.

“Why — what’s all this about?” “I shall explain everything,” repeated Dumbledore, “when Harry is back at school.” He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor.

Snape ’s upper lip was curling.

Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes.

Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.

Not everyone was convinced, however.
Expected: 3

There was a murmur of interest.

“Oh ...” he said, the memory coming back to him at last.

“It’s all right,” he said.

Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimental” Malfoy was blasted off his back.

Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder.

There was definitely no new face there.

There was a pause.

They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Harry!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs.
Expected: 7

Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.

Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground.
Expected: 7

Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.

“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open.

“You’re talking nonsense!” “YOU DONT KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape.

The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.

“And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks — ” “See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,” said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?” “That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile.
Expected: 2

“Look.” Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate.

He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought ... well ... I’m not going to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth year.” She looked extremely miserable.

He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle.

“Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he?

“So they got in through the Room of Requirement.” Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced.
Expected: 5

The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.

“Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.” Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.

“Well, that settles it,” he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can get out of this house, boy\” “What?” said Harry.

As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.

“You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?” “No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry, “not since Sirius — ” He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.

“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken.

Her blood became your refuge.

I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone...” Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that.

His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry.

“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.

“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied, “terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked!

Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst.

His eyes were blazing now.

“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know.

“But how — how do you — ?” “Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north.

Harry caught it by the handle — He heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him.

“Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me!” “I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!” In unison, the witches and wizards along the right- hand side of the dungeon raised their hands.

Hagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic.

He didn’t want to be the one who brought it all up again.

“Did you hear about Gringotts?

“Told yeh, nuthin said Hagrid firmly.

“All right — squirti” Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle- sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury.
Expected: 5

“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Any chance you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch lately?” “I can try,” said Ron doubtfully.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen.
Expected: 7

“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast.
Expected: 2

Don’t go biting off more than you can chew — ” “So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione’s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.
Expected: 2

“Never bin anywhere like it.

“We’ve got orders.

“That was funny\” Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron.
Expected: 5

After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

How lovely, and on Christmas Day too!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry’s shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly — one swallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.” “Fred\” said Ginny indignantly.

“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,” Dumbledore added.

“I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.” Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Hermione wasn’t at lunch either.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open.
Expected: 3

He also felt slightly sick.
Expected: 5

Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.

The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o’clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go.

Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog’s Head down its side street, the severed boar’s head sign creaking in the wintry wind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Don’t think she was convinced, though.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though.

He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.

Fred looked at Percy with glee.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Where?” “We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.
Expected: 6

A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.
Expected: 5

They looked all around the compartment.
Expected: 3

“But why’s she got to go to the library?” “Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging.

One of them was Levicorpus — ” “Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently.
Expected: 6

Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight.
Expected: 7

Serves him right, mind you ... after what he did.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Then the whole crowd gasped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...” “Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put together,” said Ron happily.
Expected: 3

“Go on,” Cedric said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb.
Expected: 7

He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.

“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily.

“Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm.

“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter.

“Now, as to getting students home ... there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later.

Expected: 6

Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He really didn’t want to go into the chamber.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Lee Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well.

...
Expected: 2

Was he really ill, or was he faking?

When he looked up, the figure had gone.

Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever.
Expected: 4

“No,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

First Class, if I can wangle it!” “Thank you very much indeed, Minister.” “Nasty cut you’ve got there.

Expected: 3
Actual: 7

As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them another one.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione’s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry’s head, almost knocking him out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“They love it here.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah” and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

In large red letters across his picture were the words: HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE- NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN “It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron.

Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions?

“Argh!” A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.

“I’d like a few more words with Harry.

“Not good,” said Bill.
Expected: 4

“What has upset you?” “I’m not upset.” “Harry, you were never a good Occlumens — ” The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Honestlyl” she said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.
Expected: 2

Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle’s cauldron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I don’t suppose either of you can explain this?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Shocking performance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.” “If you’re talking about Lupin ...” Harry began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Dumbledore “He’s tried,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 3

“I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

You don’t want me to do that again, do you?” Harry didn’t answer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.” Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s).
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly.

One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs — ” “To set off the Mark?” asked Harry.

Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were wide and fearful.

Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L.

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

“I’m not ill,” said Harry.
Expected: 1

He couldn’t think anymore.

“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now.

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.

They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.
Expected: 2

And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples — though I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky!” He gave them another roguish wink.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be disturbed.

“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.

I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.” “Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron’s, involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet — ” His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.

“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
Expected: 1

“I’m not hungry.” Harry felt terrible.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“A field invasion.” Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.
Expected: 2

Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station.

“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.

All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ...

“I’ve got to go and find them.

Well, as you can see — or, I dunno — can you?

“We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.” “Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak’s rope.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.” “Was?” repeated Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the picture.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You’ve saved our lives twice.” “Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly.

He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s true identity as a personal insult.

Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.

“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

But it was visible only for a split second.
Expected: 3

“I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?” Harry frowned at Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

This didn’t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Quidditch — what is this rubbish?” Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Hey — what’s going on?
Expected: 7

He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year.
Expected: 6

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Who knows?
Expected: 6

“Good!
Expected: 7

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Could you give us a few minutes?” The goblin nodded, looking sour.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Good luck.” “And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.
Expected: 6

A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.

Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man.

Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man.

I just can’t get the hang of Apparition.” “You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said Harry reasonably.
Expected: 6

“And then he will return to his bedroom.” Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

An empty chair stood in the very center of the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I’m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest.

“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk.

“I booked the field for today!

Proud?

“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor.
Expected: 5

All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a laughingstock!
Expected: 3

The bedroom door had opened of its own accord.

Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.

You refused.
Expected: 5

He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions on his father’s character.
Expected: 5

He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He wouldn’t have to get near them.
Expected: 3

Madame Maxime was still there.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his.

“My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble.

“The Trace’ll break on the thirty- first,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

“Hagrid?” He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

. . and he wants to reserve something in there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!” Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place.

“You don’t want to start any trouble or your mommy’ll have to come and take you away from school.” He put on a shrill, piercing voice.
Expected: 2

“No wonder you didn’t get more O.W.L.s!” All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure.
Expected: 4

“I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall.
Expected: 7

“What has happened to you?” “Nothing,” lied Harry promptly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Mind, who’s to say they haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?” “Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, “ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

This too belonged to a man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“But ... from what I could see ... it looked like him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

So I’m taking loads of pictures to send home to him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?

“ — and she can’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ” “Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly, “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.” Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class.
Expected: 3

“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups.

Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead — “Go!

“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron suddenly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

All this time we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around, don’t you see?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?” “Very good, Potter, very good ...” said Malfoy slowly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . but who was it?
Expected: 6

“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.

Buckbeak raised his head.
Expected: 3

“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR?

“There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy.

“And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE ARTIFACTS.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Don’t do any more magic, stay in the house...
Expected: 5

I have dismissed her.” To Harry’s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile.

“Albus told me what it was.
Expected: 7

Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

See this?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The sign creaked in the wind as they approached.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you.
Expected: 7

“You should have said something, we had no idea.” “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle.
Expected: 3

Ron muttered, “Show-offs.” “Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!” “It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.” “I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He’d had it with sneaking around and spying.
Expected: 1

Bleedin’ snoop.
Expected: 7

Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!
Expected: 3

But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Ryan!
Expected: 4

Ron turned to the other two.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Only one power remained to me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I can hear them too,” breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

But you survived to bear witness.” “And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I thought you just said — ?” “Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I don’t want to eat.” Harry scrutinized him suspiciously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Of course,” she breathed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.” He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You haven’t heard of them?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.” “We were glad to do it.” Harry’s scar throbbed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You’re both mental.” “Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about to fall off.
Expected: 1

“Charlie,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape, striding forward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was “They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to Harry.

Half a dozen house- elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted.

“Listen to this!

Very kind ter me, he was.

“I hate that Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely.
Expected: 4

— it likes the dark and the damp — ” “So light a fire!” Harry choked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle miserably.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Thought I’d apply, but apparently I ‘don’t fulfill requirements’ — ” In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And she died soon after that without another word.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Vot is it?” Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d seen movement.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry took it and shook.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I don’t care.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The Dursleys couldn’t possibly be here, could they?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it’s us going down to Hagrid’s!” “Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?” “Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

My master isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!” “Bagman — bad?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “CrucioV’ Bellatrix screamed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The two remaining empty seats had just been filled.
Expected: 4

“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything — ” “Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 3

Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.” “Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!” “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He had even signed a few of them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

His face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I’ve had a lot of respect for you.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked Atrium.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The first shock was over now.
Expected: 4

Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

...” She checked her watch.
Expected: 3

“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,” said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione’s wand too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He had almost forgotten about Flamel.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay ... but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?” “My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Someone’s coming back out of the castle!” Harry stared through the darkness.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

. . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company upon them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his broom ... but he can’t have.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, “Rictusempral” A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The speed of the players was incredible — the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father.
Expected: 6

Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination.” They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?” “Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.” Harry and Neville set off without another word.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Sounds like they think the double- crosser double-crossed them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry felt restless.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Why are you carrying all these around with you?” Ron asked her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire — ” To Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Interesting idea .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape ’s desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Know who he is?” “Who?” “ Harry Potted” Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It’s your own fault you’ve been up all night.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Well, he needed to now, all right.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

See if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.” Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The entrance hall was deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

... Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

But Harry couldn’t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.” “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.” “Oh ... yeah ... right,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Why haven’t you been answering my letters?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment.

She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.

“Thirteen-and-a-half inches.

“Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.” “Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed cafe.

“So what?” “What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?” “No, I wasn’t!

“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said.
Expected: 2

I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?
Expected: 1

“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I see Tonks isn’t on here.
Expected: 5

But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
Expected: 5

It was I who sent you the Firebolt — “Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I’m talking about you, Harry.” There was a moment’s silence.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We want to be a part of it!” There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I could do with some sleep.” She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two, and departed for the girls’ dormitories.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The nose of the car dropped.
Expected: 2

Yes ... the first task ...” He moved forward into the firelight.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Dobby!” she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze.
Expected: 7

Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.” The teachers rose and left, one by one.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed — ” “Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, “you don’t believe him, do you... ?

“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him?

“I’m looking for Justin Finch- Fletchley.” The Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been confirmed.

He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.

Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes.

Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.

“The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.” “As far as you know,” said Hermione.

Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: My Sweetheart “Nice,” he said.

“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry.

Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.” “That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione.
Expected: 6

Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly into Hermione ’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion.

The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.

The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it.

A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.

Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
Expected: 6

They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.

It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.

Snape’s thoughts .

As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in.

Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw.

“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.

Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen.

Madam Hooch was walking toward them.

“You tell me how she did it!” “I’ve been trying!” said Hermione.

All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.

He jumped out from under it.

They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.

Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?” “Search me,” said Ron.

He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire.

They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops.

“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak.
Expected: 7

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.

He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.

“No,” she said sharply.

Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry’s arm.

Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again.

Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.

Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Good-bye, Potter!” And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

God, that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee.

Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again.

“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry.

“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby,” said Harry slowly.
Expected: 5

Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee.
Expected: 5

He was sweating and shaking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — Malfoy’s fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval...
Expected: 5

Hogwarts is not a school for mad people.
Expected: 6

“But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.

The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window.

Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring.

Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.

They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.

“Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!” “He is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie — private and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf — hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people trying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ” Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly.
Expected: 4

... I’m afraid it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ... and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — “Ah, well, Snape ... Harry Potter, you know ... we’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.” “And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!” squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed.
Expected: 4

Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.
Expected: 2

“Come in and have some breakfast.” She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.
Expected: 2

Griphook jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst.

There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy’s head poking out of a window on the second floor.

“Go back to sleep.” “Nah ... presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed.

Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Professor McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it.

“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful.
Expected: 4

“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in... Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right?

Hagrid looked stunned.

“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.

“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry.

“Of all the trees we could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.” He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly.

Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door.

He had just heard something.

“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur.

Harry read it aloud: Harry — I’m flying north immediately.

Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in, scruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal.

Poor Severus ...” “If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” “I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I intended, did it?” “No,” said Harry.

Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.

It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.

“What’s the matter?” “Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” Harry bolted to the door and looked out.

Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: “Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” he had said, explaining how he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said Ron, astounded.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!” “They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly.
Expected: 4

He had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them, ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any better.
Expected: 4

Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair.
Expected: 6

Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.
Expected: 7

Professor Binns had asked for a three-foot-long composition on “The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.” “I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short.

Go and fetch him, at once!” Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch- shouldered, muttering under his breath.

“Why?” said Harry.

“It’s you who should be scared!” “But why?

“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore.

Yes, here we are.

He had never felt so lonely.
Expected: 2

When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end — ” Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.
Expected: 4

No weeping Hagrid?” “No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat.

“The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.” “Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something!

You’ve got to tell him what’s happened.

He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.
Expected: 6

He was innocent after all.
Expected: 6

Got to.
Expected: 2

He was really young when they — ” “Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.
Expected: 7

But they both had their uses, did they not?
Expected: 4

“He’s not himself.

Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon.

“Me,” he said calmly.

“Yes, Master ...” “We will, Master.

Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for dinner and everything...” “Do you think that’s true?” Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron, looking frightened.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Who had it now?
Expected: 5

When he heard Mrs. Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked Hermione.
Expected: 7

. .
Expected: 5

This didn’t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The white stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a weathered look.
Expected: 7

“Where is she?” Ron said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Seizing the chance to escape Fleur’s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

C’mere and help!” With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Dumbledore — I mean, your brother — wanted us — ” The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth ’s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.
Expected: 7

It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit.
Expected: 6

Crookshanks and the dog had vanished.

“In her office,” said Harry, pointing.

A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
Expected: 1

Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Well, look at the size o’ me, I don’ reckon there’s a broomstick that’d hold me.

“We’re playing against each other again!” “I s’pose,” said Harry.

“Professor, I vood like some vine,” said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.
Expected: 4

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1

“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling.
Expected: 3

You can imagine how I — how I regret that now.

“If it has, it’s hiding them very well,” said Ron.
Expected: 2

“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames.

Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn.

“That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s pocket.

It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly.

And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the sky.

An apparition?

“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder.

“Listen to me, all of you!

“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.

He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him.

Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.

Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.

It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could.

Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry looked around.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off “ ‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can she be?” said Ron in horror.

"... and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire.

Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead... “Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to him!” Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Carry on like this and you’ll be made a prefect.” “No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.
Expected: 4

Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the floor.

“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant.

It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.
Expected: 1

He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

You can’ trust any of ’em!” Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady.

“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked.

It looked very solid.

Then it raised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood.

He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.
Expected: 2

“But we’re not selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go from what we’ve — ” “Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf.

The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” “You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people were — were involved in those — those things, were they?” Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look.

Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray.

Dobby’s ears drooped slightly.

Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself .

“Why so modest, Gilderoy?” Harry gave a start.

His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see.

Finally Bill said, “All right.

A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.

That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn’t it?” “Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my life.” She appeared not to have heard him.

He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it.

“Time to go, Harry, dear,” she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Lucius Malfoy — ” Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledore’s body would be laid to rest.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.

Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him.

“If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast.” “You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said disdainfully.

To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in.

“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam.

Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow.

He must be Imperiused!” Lupin looked aghast.

“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy sneeringly.

“By yourself?” “ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?” said Hagrid.

Harry went back to his toast.

“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, pointing at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest.

You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?” He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.

A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his sleep.

“What can he do?” “Knowing Snape, something foul,” said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.

He didn’t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, “Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ” The Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air.

As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly.

Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window — “Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her.

Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched.

“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he said, sounding surprised.

A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply.

“She says she’ll get the Cleansweep if she can.” “Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty.
Expected: 5

“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.” “All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.” “Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here.

It was now sitting on his garden wall.

Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands.

The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d gone two paces.

If it turns out it wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said.

“We’re nearly there.

Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them.

It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying good- bye.” His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled.

“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.

“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James.

The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to do together?” Harry burst out furiously.
Expected: 5

They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

“All right, I’ll try you.

“Yes?” “Nothing,” said Harry quietly.

“Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?” George asked.

“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently.

It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.

“You’ve been shouting and moaning and ... things,” she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy.

Harry felt the fear drain out of him.

“ ’S’ time already?” said Fred groggily.

The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone.

He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

There were periods when he knew what was happening.
Expected: 4

“You have all used a Portkey before?” asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle.

I asked to borrow it, to examine it.

“Er,” said Harry to announce his presence.

“You have your mother’s eyes.

You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m talking.” Lavender jumped and blushed.

Then something clunked into place.
Expected: 5

Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry.
Expected: 7

They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.

“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” Grunt.

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe.

He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply.
Expected: 5

“All been talking about me, have you?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m away.” The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 2

“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying.

Many students had binoculars.

Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.

And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.

The summer’s day evaporated around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape’s hand still tight upon his upper arm.
Expected: 5

Crack) Quite a few people screamed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.
Expected: 4

Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It had seemed so real.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Her eyes were open too.

The book slipped from Harry’s slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “But you never told us that!” Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Potter believed my father was after Snape.
Expected: 4

I won’t tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands.

“Had a good Christmas?” he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, “I’ve been doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry.
Expected: 3

A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.

“No,” said Ron flatly.

He turned back into the tent.

It was Hermione Granger.

Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion.
Expected: 6

“He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore ’s office!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Ron fell back toward the opposite goal.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights — meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.

“No, I didn’t.

Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood.
Expected: 3

This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon- bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind .

“I jus’ knew ... knew you were like me.

“Ginny — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t want you to tell anyone?” “Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling.

At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long- winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.

“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it.

The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it.

He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly.

Her face was covered in black fur.

I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects — ” But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall.

“Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Can yeh believe that, Harry?” The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.
Expected: 6

It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them.

After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there.

It was a brilliant, sunny day.

The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns toward Hagrid’s cabin.

He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.

His head was so swollen — ” “SHUT UP!” Harry was suddenly on his feet.
Expected: 3

“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth.

Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.
Expected: 1

Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!” “I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp.

Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you.

“Petrificus Totalusl” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.
Expected: 6

He sat back down at his desk.

His eyes fell upon the second broom.

About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall.

“Very fishy,” said Fred finally.

Harry looked in the bowl again.

Its beats were numbered.

Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.

He cut to the essentials.

You must concentrate continuously upon your destination , and move, without haste, but with deliberation ... thus.” Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Mrs. Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
Expected: 4

Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again.

“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s bedside table one evening.

“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all.
Expected: 6

“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

And you’ll just let us skip off home, will you?” The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, “Accio Proph — ” Harry was just ready for her.

“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron.

“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.

As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
Expected: 6

This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.

Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh.

They were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.

He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead.

He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.

“Ill leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?” “Certainly,” said Dumbledore.

When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight.

“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.

“Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know ... Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted...

“What if she never left the bathroom?

“Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,” he drawled.
Expected: 5

“And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Hogwarts prefects surely don’t wish to skive off lessons?” “Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his schedule under Fred’s nose.
Expected: 5

Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.

I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.” The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.

He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’ all!” They had no choice.
Expected: 3

Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.
Expected: 7

The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

She looked flabbergasted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... That’s it.
Expected: 6

“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner.

... “Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

His round face seemed to sink in upon itself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“You’ll find that hard to prove,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He doubted very much whether a book could help him now.
Expected: 4

“You!” he screeched.
Expected: 2

“I did,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“What was it?” “Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Surely you don’t want to be expelled?” “Of course I don’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 3

“Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?” “Sorry, George — ” “I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really — ” “Enough messing around!” snarled Moody.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The few unbruised bits of Hagrid ’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy’s answer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.” Harry yawned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.” “So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a — a — something on students.
Expected: 2

“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“C’mon ... keep close behind me...” They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?” Harry’s heart leapt.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It just gave him a stern look.
Expected: 1

The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
Expected: 1

Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Which of you left his seat first?
Expected: 3

“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled.
Expected: 5

If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up.
Expected: 5

Hermione ’s words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was one o’clock in the morning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They didn’t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Didn’t this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But it was the man’s eyes that made him frightening.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He got back into bed and rolled over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron’s mattress creak as he lay back down too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!” Harry’s doubts vanished.
Expected: 4

He would have returned to power three years sooner.
Expected: 6

“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway.

It was a while before any of them said anything.

Actual: 5

“This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Hermione hesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?” “Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, “but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?” “Oh,” said Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

There aren’t many who’d have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And the first bit is — play to your strengths.” “I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.
Expected: 3

“I want to know you lot are okay.

But he’d never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again.

At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked .
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“They’ll have Disapparated.” “I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard.

Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all.

“I don’t suppose you do.

“Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has.

Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.

“I see a light in the kitchen.

“Yes, they were talking about Neville’s parents,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4

“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.
Expected: 5

As Harry approached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” “This is urgent,” said Harry curtly.

He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.

This is an international standard broom, this is!” “I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry’s bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy.

A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic — ” “I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny.

“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.

Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.” “King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately.

“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it?

His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren’t popping anymore.

“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,” Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’?
Expected: 2

And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!” Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.

“We shall all miss your — er — highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins.” He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out.
Expected: 2

“I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test.
Expected: 6

“Can you forgive me?” he said.
Expected: 7

“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermione shrilly.
Expected: 6

“ Hermionel” they said together.

Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville’s potion, which was now green.

The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds.

They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . “And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mudblood.

He wanted to stop me from competing.” “We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Come and have a look.” Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop.
Expected: 4

...

In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.

“Oh, come on.

Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.

“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.

He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.

“Good afternoon,” he said.

“Let me see ... how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening?

“Hagrid, that’s enough!
Expected: 4

I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.” Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Now will you listen?” Harry didn’t know what to think.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.” “Yeah ... I’m just saying, though,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Never, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere.
Expected: 3

“It’s her rabbit, Binky.

He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!” Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes.
Expected: 3

All academic ...” “Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly.

“The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them.

“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.

A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

For that, he needed his Firebolt.
Expected: 4

He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator’s podium.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

You’ve been ... Well, you haven’t been quite ...” There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.

“We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.” “But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former Prime Minister warned me — ?” At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered Dumbledore, glancing around.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.” “Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying?

Terrified the house-elves out of their wits — ” Clang.

“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He told me to do it or he’ll kill me.
Expected: 6

Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

If it hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...” A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You — you’re — ” Ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione ’s crime, “ fraternizing with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!” Hermione’s mouth fell open.

“In Flourish and Blotts.

NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE!

It means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like to use it in case they think I’m threatening them.” He gave a short, booming laugh.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I don’t need the hospital wing...

He was not looking at Fenrir; he did not seem to want to even glance at him.
Expected: 6

. . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.
Expected: 4

“You’re as bad as he is...” “What?” yelped James.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.” “Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,” said Harry slowly, still reading the story.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I know you’d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Listen.
Expected: 6

...
Expected: 6

“No one’s died this time, not even the cat.
Expected: 2

His head fell sideways...
Expected: 5

Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“So you have been to look for giants?” said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.

So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only .

“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time?

Actual: 7

“There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart — ” “What would it have been for you?” said Ron, sniggering.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus, “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up — “ — and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“That,” panted Ron, “was close.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Ron’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“She’s not old enough!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, was very strict.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“We borrowed it to cut firewood — ” “ ’ang on a minute, Greyback!

“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said.

The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.

“Generations of students have badgered me — ” “This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“We’ll take him up to the castle.
Expected: 3

Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory\ badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?” “Were you?” said Harry, taken aback.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I’ll ... I’ll try and say something to him...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I don’t know if this is a good idea.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

But I know better now.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron’s plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

But he’s older now, in ’e?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“But I must’ve dropped them somewhere!” “A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A split second later, Harry knew why.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.
Expected: 2

“Urgh.” Harry peered inside.
Expected: 5

“He used to give me free ice creams.

The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius.

Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Save your energy, sir.
Expected: 6

One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse.

“Precisely!” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Golgomath’s lot had beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Yes, comical!” Her voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered, bristling at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own body — all else was swirling darkness.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

You said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape was saying?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

That’s the whole point, you know — international magical cooperation!” To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Not sure,” said Dean.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t there,” said Lupin.

Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

Expected: 7

His twisted smile was back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Malfoy was speaking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron’s arms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Did you see — ?” He looked up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Here.” And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what’s the point of Switching it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I bet he’s learning loads.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

OUT!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Remember Cedric Diggory.” Harry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Then he started telling them everything.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and — and — ” Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack).” cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.” A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!” Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I’m not dancing,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Here you go — ” He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war against Voldemort.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

One of his eyes was twitching.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

. . you know, when .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Never at Hogwarts.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and they won’t be able to this time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“One minute!” They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I thought they were in for questioning and ...” “Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

But I’ve still got Dad.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...” The Death Eaters were laughing again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I think we should keep it off for a while.” He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

No!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Go!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Now!” There was no point arguing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“ ‘Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!’ They’re dead helpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.” “How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Did you find one?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family.
Expected: 7

“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Miniature puffskeins, we can’t breed them fast enough.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.” Harry looked down quickly at the quill.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Look at Neville Longbottom — he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.” “An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Wish we could’ve gone up to the feast.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

HERMIONE!” “How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The Dursleys wouldn’t have liked it — there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

And ...” Harry took a deep breath.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

And then Snape came in.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Don’t worry, I’ll get us back.
Expected: 6

Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky.

“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness.

Rowling closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze — And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones — he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric’s body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do — “Stun him\” he heard Voldemort scream.

Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand.

Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.

“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan.

Harry felt his heart sinking.

Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s, but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” He felt the elf freeze and released him.

The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber.

“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly.

At last they reached a door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.

Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand.

...” They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks ’s tail bobbed in and out of view.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Have you thought about that at all?” “Well ... they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

Cedric and his parents were just inside the door.

I reckon she was so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.” “Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,” said Hermione quietly.

“But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing.

Then he lunged at Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

At last, all of them were out.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

My master had found out that I was still alive.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.

They were not enslaved, as I was.

Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening.

The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle.

Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, “We were all there.
Expected: 2

Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney’s increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she predict students’ answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune stones in turn.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes.
Expected: 3

“Look, drop it, will you!” Harry burst out.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Is it Potter?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

There was a nasty, eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The minutes crept by.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past — “Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump.

“If there’s anything I can do?” “It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing.

Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.

She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles.

His school books were very interesting.

He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug.

I think I’m the one attacking everyone, Tom\” Harry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms.

“We’ll — er — we’ll go back now, shall we?” Harry and Hermione nodded.
Expected: 5

“He’s bitter.” A clock chimed somewhere.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Bring them in,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I still feel very sad about it sometimes.

The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.

It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.

“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled.

Harry started unwrapping the shopping.

“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.

“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.

“For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than — ” But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Very well.

“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4

“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles.

He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head.

“Good for you.
Expected: 5

“How did you do?” “I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.
Expected: 6

“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5

...” As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the silver.
Expected: 5

Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee.

I’m fine.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Good-bye, Peter.” Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.

Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?” “No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it — ” “Silence!” said Snape coldly.

Careful there, Miss Fawcett.

“It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron.
Expected: 3

Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully.
Expected: 5

“You made that dementor on the train back off,” said Harry suddenly.
Expected: 3

She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, “Alohomora\” Nothing happened.
Expected: 5

Harry was deluged in the foul- smelling potion within.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

... I’m the one with the wand.

Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.” Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Go!” And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be cornin’ with me.
Expected: 4

Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.

“HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER!
Expected: 3

They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy- looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Why should he be afraid of Snape?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!” Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He looked at the book still clutched in her hand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A shrill, tinny whistling was filling the room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Big deal.” His smirk widened.
Expected: 4

“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione.

Actual: 7

He was best at flying.

He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents.
Expected: 5

They had no choice but to file past her without another word.

They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore.

“You don’t seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles... All they want is an O.W.L.

There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” Hermione wondered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“So you took the wand,” said Dumbledore, “and what did you do with it?” “We went back to the tent,” said Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me — or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Somebody has been searching it!” “But Peeves couldn’t — ” “I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again.
Expected: 4

The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder.

Expected: 3

“Where ’ve you been?” Harry said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle- born Hermione Granger.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

For the first time, he wished he were clothed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“No, I don’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Everything was curved to fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the cupboards — and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Malfoy not playing?” “Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Now, please stop badgering me.” To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains.
Expected: 2

... It’s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket.

He wouldn’t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing.

Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend.” “Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I’ll do anything ...” “Just drink, Professor, just drink ...” Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire.
Expected: 6

... You don’t understand.
Expected: 3

“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione defiantly.

He realized he must be in the hospital wing.

“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin.

Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraordinary life?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.
Expected: 7

...
Expected: 2

Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!” The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock backward and forward.

The library was pitch-black and very eerie.

She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip.

Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.

One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He was still so full of anger he was shaking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Hermione?” “No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way ...” Together they ran back along the lane.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes.

... What’s that?” He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“ ‘Darling,’ he called her.
Expected: 6

I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done.
Expected: 7

“He lay there talking to himself for ages about it.

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone.

“Hagrid!

“Oh I can’t believe this.

“Tell him what has happened.

A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?” “Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But no .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter — ” “But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Narrow.
Expected: 7

I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.” Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my grandmother wants.” “Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Dear Hermione, We lost I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It looked oddly familiar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) — ” “They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who found himself on his feet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long, colored tentacles, but he shouted, “Wingardium Levioscd” and they flew into the air away from him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I DONT BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“What d’you mean?” Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?” she asked through gritted teeth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry squinted at his friends’ darkened faces.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Because my mother died to save me.
Expected: 2

He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

See them out there, skulking around?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“How do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my — ” “I trust Severus Snape,” said Dumbledore simply.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.” He stared at Sirius.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Well, happy birthday anyway.” “Wow — that’s right, I forgot!
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“But — but the password!” “He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly.

Just stay in the house.

The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.
Expected: 4

“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy tears.
Expected: 2

“All right, we’ll do it.
Expected: 2

I had the wand.

“It’s all so confusing.

I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven.

It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before.

“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell.

One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table.

“As we know, he failed.

There will be no more argument.

“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“So — anyone know the names of these creatures?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once.
Expected: 7

Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor.
Expected: 3

Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.

The elf straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.

“The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.” “All the better,” said Voldemort.

“Christmas is a time for family.” They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.

Lie low at Lupins for a while; I will contact you there.” “But — ” said Harry.

Harry also happened to be Snape ’s least favorite student.

He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.

“Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!” Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs.

Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room.

It must be very late, Harry thought.

None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece.

Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock.

Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all.

When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again.

SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.

“But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?” “No,” said Ron.

“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.

“But ...” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t be near us now, can he?” “No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead.

“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.

“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed.
Expected: 2

“Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?” “Yeah, but ... it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.

Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.

It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville’s grandmother.

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.

“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger.

He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.

“But look at him carefully, look!

He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt very sick.

Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione, indignant.
Expected: 7

All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand.

Harry glanced at the other two, then said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right.
Expected: 7

“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard in the making!” “ ’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- piece bathing costume.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited.

“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita Skeeter briskly.

“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.

“Absolutely extraordinary!

“Yes,” said Hermione angrily.

He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.

Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.

He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It’s possible.
Expected: 7

Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
Expected: 1

This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.
Expected: 6

The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “ No\ Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button.

There was a slight stiffness in the way she said “ ’Morning,” which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived.

“Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.” When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I’ll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno...” He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too long this evening.

I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time — ” “Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.

Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past.

Others had crammed themselves onto the marble staircase.

Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry’s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that?
Expected: 7

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He couldn’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.

“Told us all about playing against you last year.

Do you need help?” “No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that...

...” “Yes, sir,” said Riddle.
Expected: 6

For a split second Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter.

Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.

Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards.

“Harry, round up the others and GO!” Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps.

He did not linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.

“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered.

“I don’t know myself.

Ah, hello, Nymphadora!” Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour.
Expected: 6

He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7

Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.

Snape interrupted him.

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there.
Expected: 7

Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.
Expected: 3

Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry.

Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound.

“Why?” said Fred keenly.

Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.

“I never knew,” said Hermione, who looked tearful.

“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.

Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.

Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure moving toward them.

The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday.

“Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty- fourth,” Harry said.

“I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly.

My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and” — he gulped — “it was horrible.” Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry, this is bad.” “What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry.
Expected: 2

The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing.

She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests.

“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth.

He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day.

“I can see it!” Harry yelled.

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.

But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?

“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight once and for all.

Look at him go!” Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on .

“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.
Expected: 4

They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.

When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.

Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron.

“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand.
Expected: 6

...
Expected: 4

There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?” “How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.
Expected: 5

He turned away and ran up the marble staircase.

“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.
Expected: 6

You should’ve said Neville did it all by himself!” Hermione didn’t answer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
Expected: 3

Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
Expected: 1

“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s bed out of sight.

It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour.

“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever — ” He gasped.

“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.

The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation.

“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair,” she said sternly.

“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched voice.

None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him.

And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars!

Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes.

Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.

It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.

It was now larger than a tarantula.

Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms.

“Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn.

“Got your robes?

Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.

Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand.
Expected: 5

“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt?
Expected: 6

Thus far, however, we have done well.

With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.

Now then.

“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody, who had limped a little closer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You might remember me, my name’s Arthur Weasley.” As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’ living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him.
Expected: 5

...” Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
Expected: 2

“And — it — had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him — why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!” “Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head, cowering.

“How nice to see you in the physical world at last.” Harry’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.

“Shame.

“Wait,” Bill told her.

There had been a loud creak behind him.

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

You’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do everything you’re told — look at Dobby!” “Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled, looking scared.

Okay, let’s go.

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.

“Porridge?
Expected: 5

We’re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The only times he’d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been faced with a real snake.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He looked ghostly as he gulped.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

How long do you think I have?” Dumbledore ’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Who shouted?” “What ’re you doing?” The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

... shame it couldn’t have lasted longer.
Expected: 4

Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s handbag.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Filch won’t be able to get in to his brooms.” Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Nice seeing you all.
Expected: 4

As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry swallowed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Hagrid, get out here, you’re just being — ” The door opened.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“She says it’s the Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he would have to put his foot down.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I waited.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I came on ahead.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Neville and Luna alone of the D.A.
Expected: 6

Nobody else said anything.
Expected: 5

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“H — he was only a baby!” Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s shoulders.
Expected: 3

The car around them vanished — and so did they.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I thought we were both goners.” “Yeah, me too.
Expected: 7

...
Expected: 3

Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’ there they was, spread ou’ underneath us.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“How — how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I think it should just be me and Harry.” “Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson.
Expected: 3

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears.

“ ’Ogwarts cannot ’ave two champions.
Expected: 4

Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The witch’s eyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Being a Dark wizard catcher was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“The curse didn’t even make it into the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

That’s the Portkey.” Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But Hermione ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.” However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.” Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What is that?” he heard her say.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Get behind here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.” Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there?” “There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.” “Oh yeah?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Viktor has a slight head cold.

Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.” “Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I was watching all the time ... all those hours in the library.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was only Crookshanks.
Expected: 3

“Arthur, what are you doing?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.

Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Where are they going to hide the boy next?” “At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Who’s bin cursed — not Ron?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.

He continued to read, frowning slightly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I would never have believed it of any of you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Just now.
Expected: 5

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry felt exhausted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.” “I don’t know?” repeated Harry, “I don’t know?” Plunk, plunk, plunk.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They heard banging and a clinking of glasses.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry ran his fingers over the scar again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.” “Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 3

Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She had forced both him and Marietta out of harm’s way.
Expected: 5

“So.
Expected: 2

“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Evil, Sev.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“We’re all human, aren’t we?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a dementor halt, very close to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough?” He gave a short and nasty laugh.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He had become very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Such rumors this summer.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Hagrid looked thoroughly confused.
Expected: 5

The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind.
Expected: 5

“The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.” Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, “That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I, a spy for Voldemort?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word against it!” “Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,” said Hagrid wisely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He’s ancient.

“They flattened Peru in the semifinals.” “Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Who’s — ?” “Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How long he stood there, he didn’t know.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come!
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“That sword isn’t Snape’s.” “It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus.
Expected: 7

He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.

Percy swallowed.

“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,” said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

In private.
Expected: 6

“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Twice — in your past, in my future — we have met.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told Luna.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t — ” “This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney — ” She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of- fact tone, “You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework today.
Expected: 3

Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.” “But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Lessons will end half an hour early — “Brilliant!” said Harry.

“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron’s head.

At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.

Hey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends — “you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!” “Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head.
Expected: 5

“I must insist that you leave.

Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.

Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.

“Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he said quietly.

“Mad?” said Percy airily.

We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
Expected: 7

He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He heard a sharp intake of breath.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

But I knew what I must do.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry’s wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.

He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself.

Her face fell as she looked into Harry’s face: humor gone, terror replacing it.

He had waited for this, he had hoped for it.
Expected: 7

Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“You’ll do no more murder at Hogwarts!” Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life.
Expected: 7

You saw it the night he returned, didn’t you?” “That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly.
Expected: 5

“I know what this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.

“Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider.

“M-moved him.

Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.

Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice.
Expected: 5

Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.

The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree.
Expected: 5

“We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.” “Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred and George Weasley together, pretending to blush.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Oh — oh yeah.” He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Hermione had overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.

Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall’s face.

“Blimey, so ’e ’as.

“The Minister has seen to that!” Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this.

He unfolded his arms.

Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry wasn’t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Tonks’s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself.

Harry looked around.

Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?” “Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

For a few minutes the scene was deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what was dangerous.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Wheezy.
Expected: 6

“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione.

The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp ’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick- sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.

The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry’s guard.

As though he had read Harry’s mind, however, Snape said, “No cloak.

Harry sat there in a panic.

“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.
Expected: 1

“I believe I told you to sit down?” But Harry stayed where he was.

Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.

Every surface now shone: Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?’ ” In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Ready fer the off?” “Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all.
Expected: 7

“Yooooul” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.

Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.” “ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.

“They’ve found Montague, sir.

We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then — ” Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream.

Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.
Expected: 3

“You didn’t arrive in time to hear — ” “Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” “Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — ” “I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” said Dumbledore abruptly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

... Well ... is there anything else I can help you with?” “Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.” “Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“What are you talking about?” “I can’t stay here.” He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt like this for more than a year.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head — And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining — he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“ — He stands there — filthy half-blood “WAIT UNTIL WEVE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’m not in any hurry...” They climbed the steps together.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,” “magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“In our dormitory!

“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was — well, never mind — the point is, she spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody.
Expected: 2

“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry uncomfortably.

“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.

Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off.

“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case?

“Avada — ” Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry.

“Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?” “The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested.

Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.” “What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was coming.

Bella merely laughed.

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione.

“Well have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who looked very shaken.

“Ronl” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.

The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks.

He’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.” Harry sat up straight, interested.

Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.

Harry turned to face him, frowning.
Expected: 6

“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!” Harry glanced around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Not to you anyway.” “I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

... Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s taking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!” And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg.
Expected: 4

Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got.

This time the spider grew slightly larger.

Bode would have known he could not...

“Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it?

The only thing he really looked forward to were the D.A.

“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly.

I’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls.

Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.

“Oh hello,” said Ron.

“ — we thought it’d be something like that.” “You did?” said Harry, amused.

They came to visit me.

Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch- Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked him hard in the face.
Expected: 4

“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted.

I, however, am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial.

The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“He’s lost — ” But the end of Mrs. Weasley ’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them.
Expected: 7

“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly.

“Jus’ a precaution,” said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.

And what would happen when Snape saw it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to?
Expected: 4

He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out.

He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It was all very well for Ron; he’d been asleep, he hadn’t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear- carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable of murder.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Has she banned him?” “No,” said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain, and stared moodily at the ground.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Well ... I’ll see you around, Harry ...” And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“All right, Harry?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“There’s more to it.

... As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.
Expected: 2

“You won’t be needing it,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.
Expected: 5

Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Go on, I’ll catch you up.” “Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ” “I’ll catch you up, okay?” By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top.
Expected: 4

“Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and uncle!” Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.

“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously.

“We’ll have to buy some more today.

“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party.

“We think he’s trying to drown himself.” Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair.
Expected: 3

All the pockets were hanging out.

Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed.
Expected: 2

He had always liked Percy least of Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He still won’t say how he got all those injuries...” Hagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

What was going on?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Can we buy you a drink?” “Er ... no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, “no, thank you, boys ...” Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.

Make way, first years coming through!

“You fell off,” said Fred.

How could he be taken inside somebody else’s memory?

“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.

A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby.

“It’s just lying there.

“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.

Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.

All of them.

“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath.
Expected: 6

Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee.

. . Twice he found himself facing dead ends.

“Yeah,” said Neville.
Expected: 7

HE’S GETTING AWAY!” But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the car — he’d slammed the door shut — “Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.
Expected: 2

“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded.
Expected: 1

“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning.

“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around.

“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears.

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker.

“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys?

Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted.

“Oh, that was horrible.

“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered.
Expected: 5

It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive.

And while I’m sure they’re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t personally fancy the mortality rate — ” “You don’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,” said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn ’s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats.

Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help.

They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects.

The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.

There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra one hundred and fifty points.

“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why — why has nobody told me — ?” “The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket.

“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.” “Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone.

He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.

Harry grinned back.

Madam Pomfrey burst into tears.

He opened the back of the camera.

Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!

With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: KWIKSPELL A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside.

This explained everything.

It was no easy task.

“Can’t be,” said Ron.

He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.

Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear.

I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up.

“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione.

“See, the rest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” “Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an undertone.

He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.

The scene dissolved again.

“Isn’t it, Harry?

“Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.
Expected: 6

She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.
Expected: 6

It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.

“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily.

For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore.

He turned to look at her.

“Thestrals aren’ dangerous!

He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.

Ron had become an instant celebrity.

“Anyway, Harry, you’re interfering with reception.

Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.

Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.

Now Percy’s a prefect.

“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered.

“The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys.
Expected: 7

“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken.

Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest.

“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda, “whatever he became later.

“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.
Expected: 2

“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly.

It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time — And then it hit him — he understood.
Expected: 3

“Come on, under here — ” They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
Expected: 3

Ron stopped dead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Everybody looked around.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

. . but now, it seems as though I always knew I’d have to face him in the end.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Nervous?” “I haven’t really thought ... yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind...
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 1

“I can’t believe this ...
Expected: 4

“Took a leaf out of your book, Potter.

Why didn’t you lie, Hermione?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dare he make a break for it?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

This question had also been addressed half a dozen times.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse.
Expected: 7

Fact was, it was too easy ter trace.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way.
Expected: 2

But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Someone was creeping along the passage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I saw one the night I left the Dursleys’.” Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

You think he was playing the hero?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

You were the one saying it.” Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Stupefy\” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly hides — Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking — then, very slowly, it fell.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can’t say I blame them.

Harry turned to Hedwig.

“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione, putting the tankard away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore ’s.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Who’s your father?” “He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Was Dumbledore at the root of this?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He sank onto the bed opposite the others.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his next victim, it’s best if he keeps a low profile for a while.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge’s visit.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They’d think it extremely entertaining.” “Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

... White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he’d ever screamed in his life — And then it stopped.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — ” said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“She’s gone a bit funny.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.” “How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

...” “And the dementors?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Crouch’s hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

... As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

/ THE BOY WHO LIVED Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
Expected: 1

He’s gone to get the dementors!
Expected: 3

Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Uncle Vernon coughed again.
Expected: 2

He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Is this it?
Expected: 7

Thanks.
Expected: 7

You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail.

“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it.
Expected: 6

Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.

Actual: 6

I don’t belong here.

“What happened?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

No excuses.

She screamed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

No?” McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I mean, it’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it’s alive.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Mum!” said Fred as though he’d only just spotted her and seizing her hand too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other — Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... Then, without warning, his head hit something hard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I’ve made my decision.
Expected: 6

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“No problem,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staffroom.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in!

“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for!

The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I don’t think I could stand the shame.” Bill was the oldest Weasley brother.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood excitedly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling, “First years line up over here, please!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the kitchen.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free hand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind.

Actual: 7

The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it.

“Okay then ...
Expected: 6

“We’ve been decontaminating this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here.

Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“If you need help, you know where I am!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,” he hissed softly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And he had to get past it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Fine.” “I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“My dear boy ... what a surprise ... Minerva, do please explain.
Expected: 7

When the new term started, they brought her each day’s homework.
Expected: 2

“Yes,” he said dramatically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You’re that Snape boy!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the error of their ways.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He flew higher.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry crouched down so that Albus ’s face was slightly above his own.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

She and Harry got to their feet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“We can practice in pairs,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

...” She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It looked like hard work.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“I — I didn’t think — ” “That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.” There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

How may I be of assistance?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“There are seven in all.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Mr. Dursley wondered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“ ExpelliarmusV’ Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

People have been saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco — ” “Looks like you 11 have to break it, then, because I don’t need your protection!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!” said Ron hotly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Identical Potters.
Expected: 7

“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“You were the best, you know, no competition.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who ... well ...” Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I was trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The whole of Harry’s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting here all alone... Come and have ago...
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the Cup\ We’ve won the Cup\” Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Er — well — ghosts are transparent — ” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d have given them detention.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He stood up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.” “But how do you do it?” “By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil.
Expected: 6

She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!” Utterly perplexed, Harry got up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Who cares?” Harry said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

You could have been killed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It wasn’t moving.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Percy strode briskly forward and vanished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“OUCH!” He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Is it okay if we take these seats?” The girl beside the window looked up.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He felt several hairs part company with his scalp.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

... Oh this could turn nasty.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!” Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“What did you do with the body?” “Carried it into the forest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Never, ever again ... that was the worst — ” Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... I’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock — ” But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.” “What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

. . and yet .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It was a — a nasty killing, wasn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry’s face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?” Several people chortled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What’s going on?” “Harry?” mimicked Crabbe.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” he said slowly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He heard Madam Hooch’s shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina’s frantic voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Ill do it, I’m — ” He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Aragog seemed to be tired of talking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, “Kreacher!” The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

... Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ?” The door behind them burst open.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I noticed that last year.” “I s’pose,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“No, he’s off delivering a letter,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

One of Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Can everyone see me?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Harry?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Are you crazy?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There was a pause.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He’s got a huge snake.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

An’ she’s gonna be cornin’ an’ all!
Expected: 5

White- hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was the most beautiful summer’s day.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!” Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A very bad wizard!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Somebody grunted appreciatively.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” “Right,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“This match has been canceled,” Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...” Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“The whole of the third floor has been searched.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Potter, you cannot win against me!” she cried.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I bet Snape gives us loads.” The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Yes,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

We gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.” “W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I must not tell lies.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Oh, now,” he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’t go holding that against me!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Some of those cuts look nasty.” “I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’?” said Hagrid repressively.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“What did you do?” she said fiercely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

She knew Dumbledore ’s family too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

And he drank — all the potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets — and watched ... as Master Regulus .
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I couldn’t stop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie — Pillsworth, I think they said — ” “Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret- Keeper instead of me.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

...” “... and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny!
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“What’s wrong?” “Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron nervously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities — ” “I’m not mad!” “I know that you are not mad.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It opened silently and they entered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“For permanent spell damage, you know.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He had not heard correctly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“But this way it looks more like an acorn.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“ This is a gnome,” he said grimly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,” he said gently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Not yet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

. . something dark .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they didn’t yet know what they would find there.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again!” Harry’s heart sank.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

...” Harry looked desperately around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry laughed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“No second year could have done this,” said Dumbledore firmly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

That old cat’s the one who should be in the asylum.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

So was his body.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support — ” “After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Harry!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And the one I just came through — well — it’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there ...” Harry hesitated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The thought made his stomach clench painfully.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him.” “What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron roughly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

They had reached the Atrium.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same...” “It was you?” gasped Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry had never seen this man before.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He sprinted back upstairs.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

His scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got his Apparition test.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.

Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley.

Harry recognized Voldemort at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner’s reflection.

Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
Expected: 4

“Harry — ” But he shook his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.
Expected: 2

“Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister?
Expected: 7

When they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup’s gleaming handles.
Expected: 4

Then she opened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve made you all sandwiches.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” A cold smile curved her lips.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Weasley,” but they took it in their stride.
Expected: 6

Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“We take it in turns.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... It’s not r-really important .
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Gotta pull meself together.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Probably be blond by the time I get back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Awfully brave chap.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Go to Dumbledore.
Expected: 1

But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
Expected: 1

“We will practice the charm without wands first.
Expected: 3

“Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?” “Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss ... a spiderl” The sphinx smiled more broadly.
Expected: 4

At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.” “And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Quick!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making!
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“It’s — too — dangerous — !” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Where was Ron?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want George to think he was eavesdropping.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Snape’s sneer became more pronounced.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I tried, Draco.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Well ... it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You would have been well served if he’d killed you!
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high- pitched whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

What did Regulus have to do with it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today, they were laughing at Gryffindor’s abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing “Weasley Is Our King” so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry’s head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea,” said Snape smoothly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Oh,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“See you next summer!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He raised his goblet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry, Harry, Harry.” It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’d better go!” he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out of Grimmauld Place’s fire.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“They’re spirits of fire,” said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

We came back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be doing anything else!” “ All right'.” The moon slid out from behind its cloud.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time .
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Lovely, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

No, Harry — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!” Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

If eyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

DO NOT DO ANYMORE MAGIC.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry hoped she never found out that he’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

None of them had realized that Harry was awake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Excellent, excellent.” These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Fred and George were both helping customers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He didn’t realize what had happened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Now, let’s see.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

... Harry broke into a run.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’ disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’, couldn’t’a bin smoother.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Do you think he’s all right?” she squealed through her fingers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Let him watch while we torture the little girl.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They had not seen Hannah since.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

What could possibly be worse?” “You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” “Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in ... we’ve got to do something about her.” " “I suggested poison,” said Ron grimly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Pettigrew was turning blue.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Settle down, settle down, please!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry wondered how much he dare say.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Which should he visit first, which was in most danger?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What’re you doing in here?” Hagrid held up the limp rooster.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones,” Ron said darkly, making the second year jump.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess ... and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing anything over the summer, would I like to — ” “And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding world!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Gerroff me!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But ... but You-Knotu-Who can’t be near you now, can he?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“What was the point of sending us in there?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle’s mouth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Oh yes,” she said happily.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“If we lose this match, we’re out of the running.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Nobody else was there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.” “Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“She was the one who started it,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them.” Cedric stared at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Sent?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I’m rather attached to the pink.” Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,” said George after a while.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

There was no sign of red sparks — did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn’t reach her wand?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron’s right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

And they’re breeding.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.” There was an explosion of cheering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes: Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“But if he’s resigned — ” “ — doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do — ” “I don’t care.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry knew it was clenched around his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Her — ” Hagrid hesitated.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff?
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

When you could have been celebrating?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.” He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.
Expected: 4

Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground .

The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare.

They were completely blank.
Expected: 2

“Aragog’s worse, I bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ now an’ then Professor Sprout told me abou’ Ron!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

There was no answer but the sobbing continued.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley!
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a quavering voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He let his gaze drift over his surroundings.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

There was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.” Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on Hermione’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

. . terrible things happened.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“If you would kindly gaze into the Orb.

By the time eight o’clock arrived, every cushion was occupied.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Hang on — damn — ” He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Nice and supple.” “Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“And he knows!” said Harry with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix ’s own.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Wrote me this mornin’.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!” They stared at each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry thrust his fist in the air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“The argument became a fight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a house, my godfather left me one.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry’s jaw dropped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...” “She didn’t want us showing off,” said Ron sagely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“No!
Expected: 3

They reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows.
Expected: 2

Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could be worse.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry turned to Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Then Snape said, “I thought ... all these years .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Password?” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Move along, all of you.” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I’ll make it quick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“My dad used this spell,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Lost her nerve.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

— SHE SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah ...” Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron — Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me.

They didn’t fight with me.” “That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna.
Expected: 6

Bertha Jorkins.
Expected: 4

He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?” “Inside?” “Yes, Mr. Gaunt.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He did not answer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door under the stairs — “is where I used to sleep!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Pipes.
Expected: 2

... Why, though?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

If I was going back to school it would be different.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?” Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.

That’s where he’s doing ... whatever he’s doing!
Expected: 6

“I DONT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry glanced around at their fellow guests.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

His voice might have been part of the spitting fire.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror.
Expected: 6

“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head.
Expected: 4

“I met him when I traveled around the world.

Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin’s.

“The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes.

“Oh, are you doing magic?

“Dudley,” said Harry.

“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down,” she said, in a disapproving voice.

“Look at that!

He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape’s desk with filled and corked flagons.

“You were fantastic, Fawkes.

And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Is it easy?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Is there anything missing?” Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.
Expected: 2

“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.

“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment — ” “But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn!

They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain.

I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time.
Expected: 7

Harry had to read this sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Dumbledore answered it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He was running along a windowless passage with Mr. Weasley...
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” “Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry wanted to shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The potion turned palest pink.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I’m going to go and live with him.
Expected: 3

Harry kept looking around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

You have been inside my vault at Gringotts!
Expected: 7

Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.
Expected: 4

“Well go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I didn’t like him,” said Ron at once.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon.

This gave Harry an idea.

Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!” The spectators screamed and clapped.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“D’you think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione nervously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

. . the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next book ...in the next one .
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he said slowly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

They left the stadium right away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You used to be in there all the time.” This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I never betrayed James and Lily.
Expected: 3

“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him.
Expected: 7

He could not ... “Where Ve you — ?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him, thinking. . . .
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What do I care how he looks?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley said after a few seconds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Got all his lessons planned for him?” “Well, I tried,” she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He kept reliving Saturday’s meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You’re letting people know he’s back?” They all smiled humorlessly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Ron had his ear to the door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old — “Ron?” He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“And you, boy?” Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

You’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry approached him, looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.” Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Harry — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ” Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in- command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Answer me!” “A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?” Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It’s really there — like lightning.” “Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 2

So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

There was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther backward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Harry was rubbing his forehead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Absolutely not.” “You let Professor Dumbledore in.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House team?” said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” “Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Fine!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?” “Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked Kreacher.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’ table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to find it,” he said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but — ” “My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ” But Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He stooped a little (the centaurs’ arms tensed on their bows) and then bellowed, “HAGGER!” A few of the centaurs looked worried now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Spattergroit ’s really contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that were true.” She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Should I do mine too?” “No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,” drawled Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“He’s skin and bone!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Are you sure?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The plan succeeded.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” “Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He pulled out his wand, tapped his glasses and said, “Imperviusl” “I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered sadly.
Expected: 4

Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Ron was still white-faced and silent.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Veelal” “What are veel — ?” But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry’s question was answered for him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“You’re still doing really well, though,” Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...” They left.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

I’m drinking nothing with Crabbe’s toenails in it — ” Hermione continued as though she hadn’t heard him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He was so upset when she was — you know — attacked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

They’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it’s time to think about their future, and Dad can’t help them, and they need gold to get started.” Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Are you Bathilda?” The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

. . but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Oh, yeah — pure-blood\” said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!” said Hermione fervently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn’t close.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“He would have gone on.” “What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ ’Arry?” Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Potter and Chang!” screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

What was I supposed to say?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...” “But why did you keep him alive?” “Have you not understood me?
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry wouldn’t have thought it possible that Snape’s dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Brilliant,” said Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Malfoy’s lip curled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Didn’t even answer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Nobody did.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Big bloke.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’ll distract them all,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry looked at it, too.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Then his face split in a wide smile.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry looked around as they entered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And having funny turns all over the place — ” “I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore coolly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There wasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Then Snape said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.” “You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!” “Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But still ... we’ll know day after tomorrow — one way or the other — ” They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Just give me two seconds in the library — just to make sure!” With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Your death will not come as a great shock...” “Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape ’s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Sirius Black, you mean?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Somebody had removed his glasses.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

. .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I’ve got her!” He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rockfall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!” “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater’s robes looked uncomfortably tight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

. . and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He narrowed his wicked black eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Go!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Nothing at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He can’t get in there?” Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s Transfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my books.” He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Well ...” said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see their side’s victory.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“NO!
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg and it took off again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Well, well, well, I never thought I’d meet a third -year class who wouldn’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape ’s robes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.” Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What’s Percy writing to me for?” He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.” “Fat chance,” said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

I didn’t know that could happen.
Expected: 6

“No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?” Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag, and set to work.

“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around.

Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?” “No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Let me go!” “They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand?
Expected: 6

He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse.

It’s all that’s keeping me going.

I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all.

“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,” Voldemort continued.

You might even have a scar now, if you’re lucky.

“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.

The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Come on, we’d better not dawdle.” They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
Expected: 6

He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?” “Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is.

Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.

Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon.

There are things I need to warn you about.” “What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches.

They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn.

“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.

The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister.
Expected: 6

“Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people — ” Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.
Expected: 5

“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a muffled voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.

“I want more bacon.” “There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son.

“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “It — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.

Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Slowly, it bowed its antlered head.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it.
Expected: 6

“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.

Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.

“Me?

It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements.

“I’m not wearing that, no way.” “Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly.
Expected: 4

And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione’s.

She was holding the chain out.

On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully.

A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.

“Not on duty, eh?
Expected: 4

“That’s what you’re trying to do?” “I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You know she’s written a biography of Dumbledore?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” Harry’s feeling of stupidity was growing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
Expected: 6

“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.” Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock.

“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.

“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch.

Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers.

...” “How’s this?” “Yeah, that’s better.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“What?” He did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts.
Expected: 5

And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed.
Expected: 6

Why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change?
Expected: 6

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

But it is my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic.
Expected: 6

Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.” Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room, “have you checked the time?” He looked down at his watch and received a shock — it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds.

Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.

“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world.

Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.

“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.

“I’m afraid that, for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here.
Expected: 3

He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the younger students away.
Expected: 2

Thought he oughta see the trees an’ — an’ smell fresh air — before — ” Hagrid ’s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor.

“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back.

The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too.

The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh, Harry, it’s you... Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she said blearily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

She was white as chalk.

It was pitch dark.

“We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.

He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for.

Midgets!” “Ron\” “Well, they are, they’re titchy...” “I know, but you can’t call them midgets... First years!” Hermione called commandingly along the table.

“I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without — ” “We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Yeah,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he?” “Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.

“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.

Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past.

When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.
Expected: 4

“He must be entering the tournament.” “That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.
Expected: 4

Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
Expected: 1

“We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to — ” “We need to get going,” said Harry firmly.
Expected: 7

Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug?

He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.

“Now then ...” He waved his wand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

... Ah well, guests first!
Expected: 2

“He’s back,” Harry whispered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.

“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on, “we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens, that is.

The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.
Expected: 1

They have allowed us to raise the boat.” “But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.

“He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical — and power-hungry.

She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit.

They’d heard that Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once.

Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?” “I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 4

“We can take off his name and put yours on instead...” As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.

He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.

No, it’s been a lot of work, Harry.

“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus.
Expected: 2

“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said Hermione firmly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

. . how much?” For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Crabbe and Goyle leered.
Expected: 4

“Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, “but we really can’t spare anyone at the moment.

Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
Expected: 5

“He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!” “Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’ ” said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.

“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ” “D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?” muttered Ron.
Expected: 2

It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.

Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione ’s.

Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.

“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders.
Expected: 6

Ariana?” “Yes,” said Aberforth tersely.

Nothing changed when they left school.

A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.
Expected: 1

In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Only came out last month,” said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own.
Expected: 2

“I s’pose Lord Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name.

She coughed feebly and turned away.

Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams.

“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out.

“Are we still doing D.A.
Expected: 6

Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, “I’m ready.
Expected: 2

He’s gone and he’s not coming back.

“So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form.

He had to fight ... expecto patronum ... he couldn’t see ... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming .

His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort.
Expected: 3

“He’s too little.

He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.” Harry’s heart was pumping fast again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Oh ... oh yeah, we did.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

An’ then he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I’m his godfather, I’ll look after him — ’ Ha!
Expected: 3

The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Then prove it!
Expected: 5

His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
Expected: 3

The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby.
Expected: 6

Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse deal.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron’s elder brother Percy walked in.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I still don’t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered.
Expected: 6

“We all know you can’t get enough of her.” This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother.
Expected: 6

“This will do, Harry.

“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.

They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley.

“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it.
Expected: 3

AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?” “N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.
Expected: 3

“Scorch marks!” he said.
Expected: 2

“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,” said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered.
Expected: 6

“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

Harry stepped out behind him.
Expected: 2

Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry’s hands, flooding the floor.

“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Don’ make me say it again.

And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “He saved his life.” “What?” “Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily.

But then disagreements sprang up between them.

He gave the rope another wrench.

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.

Rita Skeeter had just entered.

Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely amused now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the giant squid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.

The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino.

“POTTER!” Harry opened his eyes.

It is — ” he consulted his watch, “five minutes to midnight.

I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did.

“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,” said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face.

The reporter had reappeared.

‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch.

“After you, Harry.” He opened the telephone box door.
Expected: 5

Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Don’t say that,” he whispered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” Harry couldn’t take it in.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I am becoming seriously concerned, I can’t deny it — ” “Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

But this was a lie.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“How?” said Hermione nervously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown everywhere.

Actual: 3

“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ .

They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).

“I want you to take this,” he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I haven’t done anything to them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Half blinded, he staggered backward.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita’s book.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?” “Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“And what’s the mirror for?” “Oh that’s my Foe-Glass.

There was no keyhole or letterbox.

“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.

You’ve got competition, Ginny!” But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s face.
Expected: 2

“I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.” Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose.

Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.

“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.

You are a WickEd giRL.

“And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages.

. . and then something else emerged from its tip .

“Oh ... tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, Harry,” said Hagrid dismissively.
Expected: 5

Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later ... and then he saw it.
Expected: 5

Harry stared at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The quality of Kreacher’s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry looked around the office.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Harry shook his head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood’s magazine.
Expected: 5

All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to escape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Nagini lay draped over his shoulders.
Expected: 7

Harry pulled out his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He wished they’d hurry up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They’re rare, them.” He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“You know where Dumbledore is, then?” “Well ... no!” sobbed Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

No Fawkes the phoenix — no whirring silver contraptions.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry did not know what to say to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Hurry!” As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I am the Chosen One.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Put that wand away at once,” he said curtly.
Expected: 5

From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

... Hippogriffs don’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much.
Expected: 3

“I heard it.
Expected: 1

They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s office.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” Harry went on, ignoring Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no?
Expected: 1

“You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” “Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away.
Expected: 6

Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Close up, Harry thought he looked ill.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

His face wasn’t twitching at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They were only a table away from him and Ron now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Good luck, Harry, wherever you are.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus.
Expected: 3

“Cho will be playing, won’t she?” Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Why didn’t they bring cloaks?” “Over here!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Tha’s all.” Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

When Harry stood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What made you?” “He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was going to get rid of him first.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...” But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us.” “I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

And Harry too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them.
Expected: 7

Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.

Actual: 4

Oh, come and stir my cauldron, And if you do it right, I’ll boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight.

And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.” “I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

There was only one thing for it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The Prime Minister’s heart sank.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

"... cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled — ” “I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?” “I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He was arguing with Crabbe just now.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about Harry, not one — ” Ron changed tack at the speed of light.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Okay ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“New third-year course schedules,” said George, passing them over.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Really?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His eyes were starting to water from the pain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.” “Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Professor McGonagall ignored her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“We must follow the established procedures.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I think he suspects me. . . .
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Don’t let Malfoy get to you, Ron — ” “Him!
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!” “Why?” said Harry curiously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn’t sensible — looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“It’s often infested with nargles.” Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his watch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met!

“It’s okay,” said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him.

If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they stood.

“Nobility of spirit” ... “intellectual contribution” ... “greatness of heart” ...

There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting.

Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy!
Expected: 5

Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a lot of work to do!” Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

But Dumbledore had overestimated him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Extra lessons with Snape — what on earth had he done to deserve this?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It tasted like overcooked cabbage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Problem?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Hermione, however, said, “Good for you, Dobby!” “Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“And you have another visitor.” “Oh, good,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Why did I not tell you everything?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He was — he had always been — a marked man.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,” said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Correct, Potter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you — ’ And then she saw my body .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood smoke from Hagrid’s cabin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I must not tell lies.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s story, Amos?” “Of course — everyone knows — ” muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly discomforted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Hermione did a sort of jig.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Destination ... determination ... deliberation ...” she murmured.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry ignored her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

There’s no Vernon Dudley on ’ere, Greyback.” “Interesting,” said Greyback.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.” “But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Then the whispering stopped.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“And Ron?” “I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left — ” The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

’Ere, ma’am — ” Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“They were just discussing tactics.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?” Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...” He raised his right fist.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

... As long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t — ” “Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The pointed archway looked much taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down on it from above.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go “You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I know — but how did you escape the Inferi?” Kreacher did not seem to understand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before.” “You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Phineas Nigellus had still not returned... “Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“ Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!” roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?” “Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The temperature dropped with every step they took.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It was very heavy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Weren’t you?” said Colin, trotting alongside him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“The hat feels itself honor- bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels — ” But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Enjoy your holidays!
Expected: 2

We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable — ” “No!” said Ron gleefully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Dark Mark had been set over it — well, frankly, I’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.” “Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we should talk about something diff — ” “Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Something that looked horribly like — “BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He felt more confident about this task than either of the others.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Ginny didn’t find it amusing either.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, “ Sonorus,” and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry and Ron froze.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

...” But already, yet another head was emerging .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry fiercely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin ’s candle, extinguishing everything.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
Expected: 7

“Excellent nosh, Petunia.

... Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore.
Expected: 3

“A plot to get this house?
Expected: 7

“I think they think I’m a bit odd, you know.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

But the bell to signal break never came.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Now get back to bed, all of you.
Expected: 1

“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” “How can it?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

What was that writing on the wall about?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“So, what’s been going on?” “Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s, haven’t I?” “Come off it!” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He’d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Well?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister.
