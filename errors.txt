“Animal, d’you reckon?” “That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.

Hagrid snorted.

Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness — “Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“We know it’s Lupin\” “Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?” “I do,” said Lupin firmly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You look ever so pale... Are you sure you slept this morning?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled- up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The veela had started to dance, and Harry’s mind had gone completely and blissfully blank.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

. . but they concerned the guilt of living people.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.

“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly.
Expected: 5

“The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“They’re called Bludgers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron’s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Now, however ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They’ll be furious.

My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Is he ill?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He even lived with her for a while.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He felt very strange.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me?” “Huh?” He looked around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Harry, dear!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

And here’s your sweater.” He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But he hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.

N G HARRY POTTER / THE WORST BIRTHDAY Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive.

Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend THE WEIRD SISTERS.

Actual: 7

“I am not leaving to go into hiding.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

We’re easily the best team.
Expected: 2

“D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his watch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You get that with dogs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

... Harry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You’re just as sane as I am.” Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Time’s wearing on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Oh no!” Hermione squeaked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he said to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hermione beamed at it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He didn’t sound anxious — if anything, he sounded hopeful.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Er — stranger than usual, you mean?” “Yes .
Expected: 3

“Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders  he had not committed.

“True, I haven’t introduced meself.

A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father.
Expected: 4

And it didn’t stop there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Come on then, girl, come on!” “Er — my — nee — no!” shouted Ron through his gag.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Then it was withdrawn.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Would it kill her to tell us what she’s up to for once?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished  when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process).
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into the room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

No Seeker and no Beaters .
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” “I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here.

Won’t say no more here.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.” “NEVER!” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Malfoy stepped backward.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned — Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

... Harry broke into a run.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

"... because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as I’m not your parent or guardian — ”  “But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Get up, you useless lump, get up!” But Dudley either could not or would not move.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Nobody in the kitchen spoke.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“But why has he sent you?” Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn’t think his legs would support him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

. . yelled .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Isn’t she with you?” “She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

. . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen ... except that they weren’t — they couldn’t be — human.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

A moment later the desserts appeared.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, “Oy, Potter!”  “What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Yes — yes, I’m staying.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Don’t go downstairs for a bit.” “Why not?” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... Why not now?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...” “My Lord ... no ...

Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

... Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You may go, Tom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Quidditch ... the last match of the ...” “Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

You try.” Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It was Quirrell!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Nobody else was there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Hermione had overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” Harry sat there, staring at her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO— THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION!

If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety.

Then Dumbledore’s face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You are a witch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, “Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” “Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!” A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white- blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Does it hurt much?” “Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry looked up.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He chanced another glance out of the window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Turn back, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle — ” “Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

They stepped through the archway.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

None of them had realized that Harry was awake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Whose hair are you ripping out?” “I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Severus Snape!” “Snape has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch disdainfully.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I could help them.” Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Send him, we can afford to lose him.” On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I would not know...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

And he had to get past it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“There isn’t anything, Professor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“There’s a difference.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

You think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Then he shrugged.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Hagrid?
Expected: 7

He threw his wand back into his trunk.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“What’s the matter?” Harry said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

And then — I dunno — I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.” “She’s part veela,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“About how he’s treated when he’s at your place.” Uncle Vernon’s mustache seemed to bristle with indignation.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

In fact, bring both, while you’re at it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“They turn silver when they’re abou’ two years old, an’ they grow horns at aroun’ four.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Wizards’ bank.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“But I still want to talk to you.” Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“The true story.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“She must know you’re out of your beds... Minerva, go and head her off — tell her any story — ” Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I have not.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

His father’s definitely evil enough.” “They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Not today.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He passed over Ernie’s navy concoction.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“ Stupefy]” Harry yelled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The class  looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I booked it!” “Ah,” said Flint.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“All melted ...” “What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall asked urgently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.” “Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They’d think it extremely entertaining.” “Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I’m a Ravenclaw.” She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles  whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape was saying to him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Thank God, thank God — ” Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they sat down too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ron was furious.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

... “Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“We’ve never been inside your vault.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a  small leather pouch tied to it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Well, you can’t do anything about the” — Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside  the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry’s responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry wondered whether he was in pain.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He had got through the first task, he had survived.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Don’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“VERY BAD BOY!
Expected: 5

“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled as a girl ran past him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Charming girl.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy.

You make a stag Patronus?” “Yes,” said Harry.

Ron and  Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.

“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule.

“I didn’t mean “WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I — ” “HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.

“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.

Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst.

“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite.
Expected: 5

“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said.
Expected: 3

“Come on, this way.” They crept off.

First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals.

“Wuzzgoinon?” “We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.

“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily.

“ EXPECTO PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ” The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry’s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet — though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure — “ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.

Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.

Hey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends — “you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!” “Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead.

Should I do mine too?” “No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake.

Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school.

Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an  unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting.

“Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said Hermione earnestly.

“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!” said Harry, taking even himself by surprise.

His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.

He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” “He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.

“Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter’s been mistreated in any way, you’ll have us to answer to,” said Moody.

She’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch restore her.” Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.

You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some — ” “Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.

The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank.

Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again .

“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore ’s to give away.

Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits.

“Why?” he said again.

Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart.

“No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs.

His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it.

Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack — a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry didn’t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him.
Expected: 4

Now get to bed.” Harry didn’t move.
Expected: 5

“No, I’m not,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily.

Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin... Hermione was lying in the hospital wing, her face covered with thick black hair.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.

There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks.

Run for it, by the looks of things.

What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

This too belonged to a man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He was afraid of it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Hermione gasped.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

There’s nothing here to hurt you!” Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“DOBBY!” The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They could each turn into a different animal at will.” “But how did that help you?” said Hermione, sounding puzzled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?” Harry blinked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Once  they’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.” Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.

It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them.

Dolohov raised his wand again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“And if you don’t mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” “I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Shouts reached them from the street below.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Fred and George Weasley.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

For several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.” Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.” “How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“This is brilliant!” And he and Harry led the way into the shop.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Fortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, “You must have some idea who’s behind it all.
Expected: 2

“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry.
Expected: 7

Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it...
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Ron was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.” Harry was sure he knew what that was about.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow.

Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room.
Expected: 2

“Detention?

Anyway, they prefer the dark...” “What prefers the dark?” Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“If they’d just listen But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley called.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I think I do see something ... something that concerns you... Why, I sense something .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by flying car.” When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself), they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What?” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Of course, it would be difficult.

“She snogged Krum.

His voice broke into petrified sobs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Enjoy your stay, Harry.” And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand, Fudge left the room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“She’s like my sister,” he went on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville’s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard’s bidding.

“Let’s go and have a look,” said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upheld, where the Bulgarian flag — white, green, and red — was fluttering in the breeze.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

What’s the matter?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...”  She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“If you’ll give me a chance, I’ll explain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter!
Expected: 7

Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry saw it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... “Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ... ?” In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Or our son, Draco?” “How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Seven years there and he won’t know himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Look.” A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,” said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.” “Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And now something very strange happened, as we know.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting with rage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“It was a dream!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Uncle Vernon’s large red face was hidden behind the morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

There was no door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“And twenty points from Slytherin!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“They’re ... they’re really ... well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Wizards who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“That’s why I’m looking for something different.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The door creaked open.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked Atrium.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He wished Ron would put his wand down.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

On Professor Dumbledore’s orders, of course?” “Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

We’ll have to risk it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It’s not been an easy journey.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“But you were unsuccessful?” Snape ’s lip curled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“ ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

She was white as chalk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he found his throat obstructed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

. . not that it needs it — ” she added, eyeing Hermione ’s bushy hair.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“It means that you are not a wizard.” “I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“How are you getting on?” Harry thought he was having a heart attack.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Welcome,” it said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I need that room ... make him get out.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

At one o’clock, the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“We didn’t know ‘security’ meant you!” “I know, jus’ like old times, innit?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?” “Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the — ”  “Write to Sirius.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

What did they do to you?” In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him perfectly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Maybe you’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I suppose you just let it out for exercise and — ” “It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing against the closed door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

They looked at each other.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I bet Sirius ’ll know what to do!” “I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry tried again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?” Harry asked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The empty goblet was still smoking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.

I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.

Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

But  I’ve got to take him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione.

Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Not to worry, well find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” Harry took the wand.

He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape ’s desk.
Expected: 2

But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done.

The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Every eye was upon Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I’ll ask her if you like.” “Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“He wouldn’!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

As Harry approached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” “This is urgent,” said Harry curtly.
Expected: 5

He had been afraid of that.

“Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets.

“There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” “My dad used it,” said Harry.

“He was ill when I was playing in that match.”  “Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron.

Actual: 5

“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermione’s — she’s got me a homework planner — ” Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s handwriting on it.
Expected: 5

“Oh, hello, Mafalda.” “Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly.
Expected: 3

He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.

. . but who was it?
Expected: 6

“Cool,” said Dean.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

You had no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?” said Hermione loftily.
Expected: 4

Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him.

Harry stabbed the number nine button, the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling.
Expected: 5

He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat.

“I know he believes you, but ...” “You think he is mistaken?

“If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my — my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick.

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests.

He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had.

And she was an idiot.

“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through?

Both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry’s face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s  turban.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

What would Ron and Hermione say about this?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.
Expected: 1

The mustache bristled.
Expected: 4

“ ’S’ time already?” said Fred groggily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.” Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.
Expected: 2

He wasn’t alone after all.

“My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty-four hours later!” “Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Why didn’t they just polish me off at the same time?
Expected: 4

“Just because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — ” “Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.
Expected: 6

“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just borrow yours for now, then.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Help me!” “Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The car wobbled again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“He failed the first time, Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?”  “Yes, well, he passed the second time,” said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.

That’s a basilisk, listeners.

He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave.

Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully.
Expected: 2

“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Got to.
Expected: 2

Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Absolutely spiffing.” Percy scowled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Well, you’d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You must remain focused.
Expected: 5

“Where is Albus Dumbledore?” “No idea,” said Harry promptly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted and had Snape’s essay to finish.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Fred and George did.” “Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” “Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much ... not to his face anyway ...” “When can we take the actual test?” “Soon as we’re seventeen.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Well be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Expected: 2

“As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies’s first goal.” Ron’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without — ” “We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will understand why soon enough, but you must promise me — ” The man called Dawlish was stirring.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.” A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now...” But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

...” They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Why us?” “I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said Scrimgeour.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” “Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s possible.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Anyway ...” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape’s essay.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little shakily.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class — ” “I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The battle had begun.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Not for her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

HE’S GETTING AWAY!” But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the car — he’d slammed the door shut — “Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He was looking pale and stunned.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Oliver Wood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?

The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it.
Expected: 4

“What’s the matter with you?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Excellent,” he said.
Expected: 6

Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You said you’d go to the deathday party.” So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“We have corresponded, of course.” Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“In fact ...” He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“How — could — they?” she choked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

. . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached)  and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” “You got there?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

...”  He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging the polecat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

If I could just let her out at night — ” “Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Tha’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He left without another word.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him.” “He died?” repeated Harry, shocked.
Expected: 6

Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“It’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?” “It still had a willow-patterned shell, d’you think that 11 count against me?” Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags?
Expected: 7

As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

...” “Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, “where they’ve got everything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Wouldn’t have done it myself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“About Crouch and everything?” “No,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his test.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was quite as ugly as the old one.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“And I can’t find the story anywhere else — ” “Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron desperately, checking his watch.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn’t a better explanation of what happened, and if there’s an alternative story available, even if it is published in a” — she glanced sideways at Luna, “in a — well, an unusual magazine — I think they might be rather keen to read it.” Rita did not say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.

Harry went back to his toast.

You is killed him!

The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King’s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Go on.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back — ” “You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

...” They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I give you this — prophecy, is it?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione’s.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

We could send Norbert to him.
Expected: 1

’E is too young.” “Well ... it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“They mustn’ find yeh here.

Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I have half a mind to leave now!” “Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“The Ministry’s not too happy.” “Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs. Finnigan.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Wha — ?” He didn’t know what to do.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“All right, all right!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, “This is a joke, right?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Well, get back to your common room where you belong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for them...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What sort of diversion is it?” asked Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Someone said he was up on level one.” “Ah,” said Pius Thicknesse.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any more information.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And there was Peter, on the front page ... on this boy’s shoulder.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Rude you was about poor Myrtle.” He took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Very pleased to meet you, Ron’s told us so much about — ” “ Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

My God, my father told me about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The band had begun to play.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Why would he have left you an item so rare?”  Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“See, the rest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” “Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an undertone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them.
Expected: 3

Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
Expected: 3

“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair.
Expected: 6

“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Ginny’s got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,” said Percy loftily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Well, if that’s really the best you can do She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

She had given him too a book that resembled a diary, except that it said things like “Do it today or later you’ll pay\” every time he opened a page.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It did not contain birthday greetings.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Wait.” For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I could tell it was really rude, of course — ” “It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,” gasped Ron, coming back up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It’s not a good combination, Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I still don’t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said Hermione more forcefully.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.” A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” After that they didn’t have much chance to talk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing — ” “I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Her clothes were ragged and unwashed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“ There you are, Harry,” said a voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last — Something brushed his ankles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I met him!” growled Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Knows all the crooks — well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry interrupted her before she had even started.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive.

Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, “Expecto patronum).” Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand.

He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.

He had been inside Dumbledore’s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently.

“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.

Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.

“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.

“It’s got an amazing defensive mechanism — hold Trevor for me...” He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag.

Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons ... the only champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum.

He looked around at the others.

“What have you got to say about that, eh?”  “Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly.

“Do something,” he said desperately.

Harry went straight up to the  dormitory.

“I should have realized.

He was so upset when she was — you know — attacked.

Actual: 7

“So,” he said, straightening up again.
Expected: 3

He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.

“Follow me!

“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?” Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle.

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low- growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge.

He’d escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn’t completely useless.

“What?” said Harry.

Snape turned back to face them, sneering.

Actual: 6

So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what ’e paid in the first place — ■” “I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter.

Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket.

“Pretty big, see.” “Where are they?” said Ron.

Would none of them understand?

Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit battered.

The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air.

“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach.

Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.

As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.

A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, “In broad daylight!

I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons — ” “We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said Fred indignantly.

“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again.
Expected: 3

Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“He come back, see,” he added stupidly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted.

Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.” From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.

“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione in a rather small voice.

“Snape ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” “What do you mean?” asked Ron.

“Help me, Harry,” he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart.

Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It was a very odd watch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Good night to you all.” “An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.
Expected: 7

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Oh, well ... I’d just been thinking ... if you had died, you’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” said Myrtle, blushing silver.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Draco Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say “Unfair.” Harry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things.

Wood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face.

On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.

A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.

“You realize that, don’t you?

Fang started to growl.

Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness.

Actual: 7

Never the whole truth!
Expected: 7

SNIFF — SMELL HIM!” Harry was on his feet, ready.

As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

Actual: 4

Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

‘I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl.’ This is what she meant, isn’t it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?” “Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Nobody spoke much.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Well ... if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?” “Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, “let’s go and find the others.” “Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.

Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and scrawled a few words.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Winky?

“Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing “Rubbish,” said Hermione.

Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.

Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.

“And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.” Harry was so angry with her that he did not talk to her for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one.

Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue.

Clunk.
Expected: 4

“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron.
Expected: 6

He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters.

Actual: 7

These people are trying to capture and kill you!

“Of course now!” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5

What’s that you’re holding, Potter?” “It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry.

“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” “May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Please.” “And what will you give me in return, Severus?” “In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.” The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth.

Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water.

And Ron looked even unhappier about that.

“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione.

Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.

“Ron, that was my foot!” Harry felt his way back to his seat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements.
Expected: 7

Yer mad.

“Brilliant,” said Harry.

“You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes.

The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone.

Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.

“So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,” whispered George.

“Very pleased.

Tonks’s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself.

He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear ... yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.

He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows.

He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.

Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.

“Doing what?” “Getting to all her classes!” Ron said.

“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally.

“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.” Ron dropped his wand.

“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.

“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” “Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back.

The doors slid shut and he was rising.

The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty.

Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks.

There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.
Expected: 5

“Go home then,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

He made as though to stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again.

I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.” “I don’t — ” “I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply.

“Not so much as a warning!

“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.” Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves.

We must keep our focus!

They were almost at King’s Cross when Harry remembered something.

... Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium, “I give you ... PotteA.” Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams — all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.

“I did them over the summer.

Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff.

Nothing!” “Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed.

“I — no — ” “Give it to me!” “Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.

Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.

Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.

There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s throat.

“I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult antidote.

Harry raised the sharp black quill and then realized what was missing.

If I’m not back in an hour ...” There was a very pregnant pause.

THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed.

“Come to get your new books?” “Yes,” said Harry, “I need — ”  “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside.

“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said.

She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.

“Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it?

Well ... it’s not in their natures, is it?

Ron, however, rounded on Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

And Harry’s still with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!” Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I ... dunno ...” Harry gasped, sitting up again.
Expected: 5

An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight.

They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.

But I mean to say — look at the fellow — ” “I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ” “Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head.

But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control — ” Harry shifted guiltily in his seat.

After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.

Stay calm, it doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means... “ Mimbulus mimbletoniaV ’ he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forward once more.

Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.

He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him.

“Quite excellent!

An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.” “I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches.

She’s a good-looking girl, but still — French.

Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet ...

The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him.

Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid!

It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction.

And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.

Ron started to direct the black pieces.

Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.

I can help you.

He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming — There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.

“I — what?” “A Wrackspurt ... They’re invisible.

“I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ” Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal.

Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?

He got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub.

Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.

“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 2

Tom, what am I going to do?
Expected: 2

My herd has banished me.” “Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she was thinking of cows.

Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.
Expected: 6

“We can’t get through — it’ll take ages.

And that ... that was what happened,” Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.

“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big plans for this money.

Harry picked it up and felt it.

“Where is the beast?” “It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously.
Expected: 3

His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.

Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side.
Expected: 6

“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.

“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief.

“Come on, would I?” “How could she think I’d like something like that, though?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.

“We did it!

She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore.

“I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.” “I try not to either,” said Ron.

And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.

Then she was covered in darkness once more.

“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had died.

I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead.

Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air.

Then I can — ” “Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly.

“You know what to do,” he said.

A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name.

“I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young — ”  “They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously.

“It’s his birthday, Professor,” he added imploringly.

More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.

Expected: 5

“I don’t know I’m doing it!” “Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?”  “What, like reading kids’ stories?” “Dumbledore left me this book, Ron — ” “ — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!” Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?” “The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Draco — fetch Professor Snape.” Malfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me to spoil that night of triumph... “Do you see, Harry?
Expected: 5

“Well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all.

“Yeah ...” said Malfoy.

“Professor Snape made a terrible mistake.

He said he’d have time after Christmas.” “Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing.

Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk.

“I know you’re not.

“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.

Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move.

Why else would he want it?

Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness.

Marge’s train gets in at ten.” Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?” “I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want you butting in!” Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I wish I could go with Mum and choose... She’ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great... Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows...”  He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.

Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and  landed on the edge of the forest.

“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said Hermione waspishly.

“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,” said Harry in a low voice.

“On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin.

All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.

“That’ll be them, will it, Potter?” He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat.

The wood had splintered apart completely.

Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch.

Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches.

She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.

“Why?

“After everyone’s gone to bed.” Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“This ... this is some map, Potter!” “Yeah, it’s ... quite useful,” Harry said.

“You used to be in there all the time.” This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.

“I’ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately.

“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.

“That’s if he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts.

Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.

From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, "... tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason.

Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know.
Expected: 3

The five Potters approached the barrier.

From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.

“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I really don’t think — ” he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.

“I wonder if Cedric knows?

“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs.

...” “Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re- being- very- sensitive sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now.
Expected: 4

Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup.

“I don’t blame him for wanting to stay here.

Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.

“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You — you — ” “Hermione — ” “ — you and him!” “Hermione, calm down — ” “I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.

Actual: 7

“I’ve had enough of this.
Expected: 3

...” The villagers exchanged dark looks.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.
Expected: 6

“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.

If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him.

“Bardy Weadley.” “A Weasley?” rasped Greyback.

“Maybe I’ll break the tradition.

“Dumbledore told you about it?” “Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging.
Expected: 5

“How come you’re here?” Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.

“Yes, I did.

“Come on!

Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his  pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry’s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Don’t touch if!” He crouched down.
Expected: 6

Voldemort is no different!
Expected: 6

When he passed on Firenze’s message, Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback.
Expected: 5

“They really know their stuff...” “Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone,” said Hermione disparagingly.

“You read the sign, it mentions teams too!

“The Prince only copied it out!
Expected: 6

“I don’t have the right kind of background, for one thing.” A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I mean, it’d just go right through you, wouldn’t it?” He had said the wrong thing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken.

Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.” Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first.
Expected: 5

“They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them.

“He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two words together,” said Fred impatiently.

From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter.

“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the only way to deal with these people?”  “Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door’s runner beans.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It was all delicious.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.” When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: “Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.
Expected: 2

“Captains shake hands,” ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

STOP!” There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci — ” “ SECTUMSEMPRAl” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.

“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”  He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg!
Expected: 4

He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm.
Expected: 2

Rising into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The cat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall.

Harry could smell cooking sherry again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.

James roared with laughter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Voldemort had entered the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.” One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“That was funny\” Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I hate that Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Hullo,” he said, smiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

...” Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with chocolate in it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

In the blink of an eye they were gone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the Beauxbatons horses’ paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Students in the corridors!” “They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGonagall.
Expected: 7

He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class’s attention was even less focused upon him than usual.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

She was a very pretty woman.

I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook!

He didn’t want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup.
Expected: 4

“I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret- Keeper instead of me.

He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“What’s wrong with everyone?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

If he told Harry he couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It doesn’t , Harry, you’re just getting carried away.
Expected: 7

The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four.

The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.

“I’ve been living off rats mostly.

“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him.
Expected: 3

“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“D’you think there’s any chance at all she’s not — you know — ” Harry didn’t know what to say.
Expected: 2

Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky.

Snow was falling.
Expected: 5

I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away.

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.

Expected: 7

I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s what I think of you!” Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You can talk to snakes!” “I know,” said Harry.
Expected: 2

Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.” “Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess,” said Lee.
Expected: 7

“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding world).
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

You fly as well as your father did, Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

When Harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

... And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him.
Expected: 1

“Lemon drop!” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry couldn’t sleep.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.” The teachers rose and left, one by one.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Told you,” said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, “told you she’s obsessed with house — ” But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up and down.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He raised his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

2.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Howard, isn’t it?” “Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to  hope for.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“And be sure to get out at the right grate.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn- rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He waited.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“My Lord.” Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“And you’ve been letting me mime everything all day!” “Veil, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden firmly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I would like you to join us too.” As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Really, what nonsense!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The feast, remember.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Who’s that?” “Who’s that?” “Ginny?” “Hermione?” “What are you doing?” “I was looking for Ron — ” “Come in and sit down — ” “Not here!” said Harry hurriedly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle  crawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out Hagrid’s next words.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“And if we can’t trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.” With so much to worry about and so much to do — startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight, secret D.A.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I would’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn’t been holding me back.” Harry stared miserably at the dark window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Wormtail sniggered shrilly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

How did you know?”  “We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred explained.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“She’s an awful woman,” said Hermione in a small voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He felt more confident about this task than either of the others.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’ night,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I will be writing to both your families tonight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“But acromantula venom is very valuable ...

Finish  the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” “The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Thanks.”  “What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape’s prone figure.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

When he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Wait!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

... Dumbledore ...
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

As they reached the first landing he said, “Things are changing around here, Potter.” “I’ve noticed,” said Harry coldly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Yeah ...
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.”  “Won’t make no difference!” sobbed Hagrid.
Expected: 3

Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The last shop was narrow and shabby.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!” he said happily, pointing at his bare chest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I need to address the students in any case.” “All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock in the evening.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which  resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.” “Well, in that interview,” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.” “Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon — double Potions — feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

...” Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.” He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?” Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back?”  “Yes,” said Neville, “everything’s settled right back down again.” “I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

She reported his trial, she knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You tell me how she did it!” “I’ve been trying!” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“So Lupin took over.

“ Crucio \ ” The air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells.

“I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.

“Just appear out of thin air, you know.”  “Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth year.
Expected: 3

Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank at once.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

At school, Harry had no one.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas as they went.
Expected: 5

Thanks.
Expected: 7

You’ve been ... Well, you haven’t been quite ...” There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.

And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back.
Expected: 6

“HAGRID?”  He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
Expected: 3

“ Tis strong for a house- elf, sir,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They weren’t.
Expected: 1

“Jealous of what?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?” “No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all.

“Personally I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year, even with our O.W.L.s coming up!” He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, “Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he went on, “I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period.

“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he said, sounding surprised.

He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping — the result was that he’d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.

Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.

Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead — “Go!

“Said she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at my house.” He winked at Harry.

Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.

He was in a very good mood.

“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast.

And Moody was all annoyed because he didn’t turn up, so that doesn’t seem like he was supposed to be on a iob for them, does it?” “Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” said Hermione.

He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.

But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be.

“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.

Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him.

Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened?

Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand.

Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart.

Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.

“What’s the score?” “We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night.” “I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.

Harry felt the color rising in his face.

“Why you?” “I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,” said Snape silkily.

“I ... was a fool.

“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him.

“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.

“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
Expected: 7

“You’re being rather rude, you know,” said Luna serenely.
Expected: 5

She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.

And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn’t help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric’s arm — “Stand aside!

They went to sit down on either side of her.

You hurt her!” “No — no I didn’t!” But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused.

“That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty.

Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral.

“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said.

Actual: 3

How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.” Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

But you found another way, did you?” “Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet.

“Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on now — let’s get outta here.” The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

... I’m to blame, I know it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and intimidation.

Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?” “That,” said Harry, “is a really good question.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry did not answer.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it  upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Where did you get this anyway?” “The library,” said Hermione predictably.
Expected: 6

This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg, hatched beneath a toad.

Ron’s grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Oh, all right,” he snapped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before.

“First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look at him — ” “Look at Lynch 1” Harry yelled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.” “So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of you at Christmas — ” “What request?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Quite right!
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“His soul?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

But you did not ... you did not.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf?
Expected: 7

It looked like an unused classroom.

“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.

“Dumbledore — you can’t.

“ Aaaaaaaargh !

Will it hold both of us?

The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank.

“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick — ” “Where is it?” “Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room — ” “No problem,” said George from the front passenger seat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“And he ordered — Kreacher to leave — without him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in?” “I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

...” An odd shiver passed over his face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said, frowning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

How could you?’ And then he went for his wand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the younger students away.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“There are other ways in — WEVE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!” Harry spun around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Impressive,” Harry said quietly, grinning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Anyone want a bet?
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to protest, “that Regulus changed his mind .
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Then he remembered that he didn’t know the password.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“But you were going out with him!” “Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“So ... anyway ... enough abou’ me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

. . when you are ready, you will know.” And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The crowd murmured behind Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.

Actual: 6

Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You will not tell anybody what you saw!” Snape bellowed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He turned in time to see her flying through the air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.” He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.

“He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME “Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

... Where’s Snape?” Professor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite teacher.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It is also, however, dangerous.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He’s gone to get the dementors!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Harry, your dad’s — well — dead,” she said quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Well, now — Mr. Potter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“So what about Ron?” “Well ...” said Parvati slowly, “I suppose my sister might ... Padma, you know ... in Ravenclaw.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.” Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The door of the compartment slid open.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

... No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly ... no, I don’t really want to.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Never bin anywhere like it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry stood there, hand still outstretched.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Griphook unlocked the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You won’t need them.” They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

... You mustn’t.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been contested between wizards and goblins.” “Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

No more detective work, or I’ll write to Mum!” And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Little stars erupted in them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!” Harry’s heart did a somersault.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said Ron tensely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“You dislike the name Tom’?” “There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech — Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

You had your head in my fire.
Expected: 5

. . then, for the third time, the whistle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

. . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.” “They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Come along, Potter,” she whispered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Them!” said Stan contemptuously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Ogden ran for his life.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They carried him past under my portrait...
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Why didn’t we think of snow?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.” Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He wouldn’t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Neville looked confused.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?” said Professor McGonagall eagerly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But I don’t think so, not anymore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I don’t get it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“We want to be a part of it!” There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Where — where are the others?” gasped Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Maybe his father?” She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart- dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Very well.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You could’ve taken anyonel” said Ron in disbelief over dinner.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I’ve just thought — Hermione.” “What about her?” “She doesn’t know about the troll.” Ron bit his lip.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry’s cauldron with a wave of his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!” Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“He wants something mended .
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ” All three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Dumbledore answered it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He was looking at the other boys.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Right — I’m forbidding you to fight each other!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

And twice I failed to kill you.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back down.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was  most convenient and I used it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry hastened to join them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

But the question was, how to call him?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He couldn’t deny either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn’t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

What was going to happen to him?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Chamber — what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you — ” “You don’t understand, Professor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“He hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill’s words.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Ah!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind a bit of rain.” But it was considerably more than a bit of rain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job.
Expected: 2

“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Hedwig’s cage stood next to it, still empty.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words to himself.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.” “You can see them any old time,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...” At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn’t be much help in this subject.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I am aware of the instructions.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“They’re in charge of all discipline.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Come and sit down!” Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harry’s, not looking at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You mean he’s — ?”  “Still here somewhere?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?” he asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

... You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

We could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.” “Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“What’s Malfoy doing?” Harry and Hermione went to see.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large  wooden wireless set.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

What is it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Found the perfect place!” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.

Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls.

Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.

And Ernie McMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them either!” Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape’s essay.

“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said Hermione, slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death Eaters — ” “Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to speak long before this.

“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles.

Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned.

Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking.

Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.

“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire.
Expected: 7

Nvbl ... that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A.

Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?” “Oh, something really silly .

Did it fall on you?” “No,” Harry called back, panting.

“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open.
Expected: 5

Decided to bring you to ’im.” “Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration.
Expected: 7

His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could  make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

“It’s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!” “I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.

“I was just thinking of making one.” “All right,” said Harry awkwardly.

Well done, car — ” The car, however, had reached the end of its tether.

The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches.

“ ’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime.
Expected: 4

“I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he’s heard a very rough crowd lives here.

No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...” But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he’d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.
Expected: 3

Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.
Expected: 6

A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase.
Expected: 6

I now ask the jury — ” “Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”  “I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth.

“Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!”  “You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie.

“That’s the post office — ” “Zonko’s is up there — ” “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ” “Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“ Point Me,” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.
Expected: 4

“And what about you, ginger?” “Stan Shunpike,” said Ron.

Then, if you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summ — Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!” The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses.

Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.

He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?” “Inside?” “Yes, Mr. Gaunt.

You told me you had to keep drinking.

Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.

Harry snorted.

“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry.

On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

One Horcrux down, mate!” Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Can he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?” “No, I’m not!” said Harry.
Expected: 3

Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister.
Expected: 5

Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn’t seen them coming.

Rita Skeeter ’s eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.

“You know, I’m starting to think Hermione was right about her” — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead — “she’s a right old fraud.” “Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth.

“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.” “And how do you conjure it?” “With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.” Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory.
Expected: 3

It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax.
Expected: 6

His voice might have been part of the spitting fire.
Expected: 7

Harry wouldn’t have thought it possible that Snape’s dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had.

He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead.

Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn’t Petrified.

This was his memory.

“Well, they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5

Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities.

It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.

It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.

It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps.

“If you’re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened security.” “Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor.

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books.
Expected: 7

There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.

Yes, indeed, oh, very good.

“And what did you tell her Ron’s got?” “A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.

Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it — the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.

“Evans!” James shouted after her, “Hey, EVANS!” But she didn’t look back.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.

“I know all about you.

“How did he know — ?”  “He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly.

“Weasley!

“D’you think ... could this have anything to do with .

“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed.
Expected: 2

“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back.
Expected: 4

Harry noticed  that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Alohomora\” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
Expected: 6

His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions.
Expected: 6

“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“MUUUUM!
Expected: 2

They knocked urgently.
Expected: 2

How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?” There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

. . the locket .
Expected: 6

You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!” Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.

“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry.

“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.

“Yep,” said Hagrid darkly.

“Very good,” said Wood.

They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Why did you have to make it so difficult?”  Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They inched closer.

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
Expected: 1

“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted.
Expected: 7

Don’t look at it, Cecilia, darling.”  The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again.

“Show yerself — I’m armed!” And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either.

Who cared about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave... For a moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Then he should be up and about in no time.
Expected: 3

He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn’t have explained.

“Wish we could’ve gone up to the feast.

As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.

She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this .
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Potter!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Tea?” Harry asked him.
Expected: 6

Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

You must be so proud.” There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I say so in Year with the Yeti.
Expected: 2

“But what’s been going on?” asked Mr. Weasley again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” The Slytherins were cheering.
Expected: 1

Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss .

“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

... It’s over.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione ’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“He has even attempted to have me followed.
Expected: 6

“No.

Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ... Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We’ll take you up to the hospital wing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

After he had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

You, boy,”  she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf.
Expected: 3

“We’ve been improving it.” The badge now read BigheacL Boy.

Of course, the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid’s fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English... “Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said Hagrid hopefully.
Expected: 5

Snape did not speak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

One of his eyes remained closed and puffy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“What?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It’s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.” “Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” he said to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Though still severely shaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth of detail.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“We don’t care about staying anymore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” “Right,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes.
Expected: 4

“A bit more than that ... and a bit more ... that’s the ticket.” Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Good thinking,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old- fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“He put a bet on you, mate,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry and Hermione brought up the rear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Explain,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- Know-Who?” “Good question, Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“That egg!” Hermione hissed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

But someone else had considered it ... someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Remember .
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

What’s that you’ve got there?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

You might have set a record, Potter.” The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Weird things, aren’t they?” “Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as Ron bounded back through the door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

You must act as you see fit.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril — ” “I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

And he was a top-security prisoner too.” “But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione earnestly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

”  Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Today we shall discuss — ” Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn’t covered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy- looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London.

Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells — “You bust slug!

Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps.

I only said I’d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday.

He could not fight the pain much longer: He had to succumb.

“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but I’ve had words with them — ” “What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Slowly they moved toward the doors.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I think I will go in now.” “Eh?” said Hagrid blankly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

You are the real Harry?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Give it here.” Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Here you are — ” She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic.

“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron suddenly.
Expected: 2

’Ere, ma’am — ” Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So this was what it felt like, being Goyle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“His memory’s gone,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.

They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them.

Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.” “Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.

He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney — ” She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of- fact tone, “You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework today.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A.
Expected: 7

“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“He was starting to grow on me.”  The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“So — can I go then?” he asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Right,” said Wood.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

...” Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.

“Why haven’t you been answering my letters?

They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed.

He was expelled from Hogwarts.

“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted.

“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment.

“If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods.
Expected: 7

...” But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s the point?” “Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I’ve been there on holiday, did you see — ?” She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express — ” And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

We’ve got to stop seeing each other.
Expected: 6

“Knew there was something ... ah well.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry leaned farther over the banisters.
Expected: 5

“Ginny,” said Ron.
Expected: 2

“ They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home.

Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?” But his question was answered before he could finish it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?” Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The egg was lying on the table.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth.
Expected: 5

But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first.
Expected: 7

“Look at the lake!” From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water — except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all.

But the night’s surprises weren’t over.

Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.

“The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will — ”  “That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them!

“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred.
Expected: 7

“ ‘As long as necessary, Wood’ ...

Ron crawled to the four- poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I must not tell lies.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Concentrating hard?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.

Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.

“Well — there might have been!” said Hermione.

Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.

“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.” The classroom was silent and still.

“We were all idiots!

“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

There was also an enormous, claw- footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the Sorting Hat  Harry hesitated.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“What are you doing here, Potter?” “I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback ...
Expected: 6

We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon.

Was he cursing someone?” “No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell — ” Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again?

“Are you still there?

“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the password had been changed the previous day.

“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.

Harry and Ron grinned at each other.

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.

But you survived to bear witness.” “And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy?

With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.

“Can’t you — ?” “I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost.

Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.

Harry recognized the tea towel at once.

Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape’s desk.

It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut.

As they rose from the table, Hermione got up too, and taking Harry’s arm, she drew him to one side.

“Good Quidditch conditions.

Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play.

Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.

He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute.

Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.

Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish.

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.

Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders.

The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of its owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon it as the Weasleys’ old Ford Anglia; although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably.

Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them.

But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse’s neck.

Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster: “And what do you want?” Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“HAGRID!” Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.

It seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe...

Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t see him laughing.

In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.

Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron  in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express.

“There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait ...” She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted.
Expected: 7

“Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?” “What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.

Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing anything over the summer, would I like to — ” “And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione.

Dumbledore smiled.

He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly.

Dumbledore shook his head.

The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole.

“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.

He looked mean, unlike himself.

“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily.

Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street.
Expected: 3

“Hang on — I’ll let you down — ” He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus\ with all his might.

“It is!

Something he didn’t have last time.” “When he was powerful before?” “Yes.” “Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry.

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron.

He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” “Mr.

“Poor Gryffindor ... fourth place this year, I fear ...” And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.

He continued to read, frowning slightly.
Expected: 2

We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.

“ ’Old tight, then ...” BANG!

He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff.
Expected: 4

... “How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly.
Expected: 2

“This is urgent,” he said fiercely.

Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.
Expected: 2

“See you, then ...” The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks.

Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.” He left.

“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” said Dobby seriously, “when they have real need of it.

I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened?” His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.

“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said Mr. Borgin coldly.

“Well done,” said George in a low voice.

Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.

He’s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs.

Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.

He did not know what to think.

“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak.

Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a  spangled banner stretched between their tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES’ INSTITUTE.

A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby.

“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione.

“It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.” “Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.

“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said.

“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter.

“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry’s nose at the same time.

He’s been killed by a fox.” “Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.” “I should have known!” said Lavender tragically.

“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.
Expected: 6

“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Maybe they’ve just made something up to get him!” There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this.
Expected: 5

He turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved.

All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep.

“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia.

“Yes, please,” Harry panted.

“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he?” said Fred.

Ron and Percy were next door to Harry.

Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.

Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.

His eyes were starting to water from the pain.

Ron’s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.

Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.

“How lovely!

“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite room for improvement.” Zacharias Smith glared at him.

“The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!” “Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly.

Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably.
Expected: 5

Someone’s coming back out of the castle!” Harry stared through the darkness.

The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits.

Do not look at me like that, Potter, you deserve it!

“What was that?” “Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.” Harry looked back at the water.

“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers.

Actual: 2

It looked like an ordinary sink.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“If I  didn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He’s massive, one o’ the biggest ones there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?” “We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.” “I understand,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office this time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They were in the hospital wing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back?
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I think not.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Try — ” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy ...” “How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she?
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Listen to me.” She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Other parents weren’t likely to want their children exposed to me.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He was safe.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

. . then — “Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Then he said, “That’s an idea.”  “What’s an idea?” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Good.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“So.” Harry would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but he didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He started to walk toward it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...” His voice trailed away hopefully.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“The same face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I know some good ones now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I thought he was waiting for us!” Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“We were going to — to go and see — ” “Hermione,” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Dobby doesn’t care what they think anymore!” “Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack).” cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

We can arrange transport home afterward.” “Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.” “But how do we know which to drink?” “Give me a minute.” Hermione read the paper several times.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Don’t nag.” Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

... We don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“But you’re different.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Malfoy mouthed “Remedial Potions?” at Harry behind Snape ’s back before following him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...”  “You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel- bright across the square.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

And I’ve seen the real you, I saw you last year.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He couldn’t believe it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The cat didn’t move.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry gulped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Now we know where they knew each other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I mean, I can’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I?” There were titters from the crowd.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

One — two — three — ” They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He, Ron, and Hermione had gone ... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“We’re coming,” said Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Mind your own business.” “What a snappy retort,” said Fred.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Hogwarts Express will leave  from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three- quarters, at eleven o’clock.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He got the letter last week.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff — maybe even Patronuses.” There was a murmur of excitement.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I suppose he knows about all this?” “Of course he knows.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family .
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than — ”  “I didn’t say it like that — Harry, I didn’t!” she cried.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I think I’ll go and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry’s growing list.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Everyone’s told me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Righ’.” He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry looked around.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Seeing things, eh?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree’s blows.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry leaned in.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Baboon’s ... backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival, George stirred.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

See you later,” and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Very — erm — very nice place you’ve got here.” As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn’t go down too well with the Dursleys.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I know how to get in.” “We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ...” Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“New third-year course schedules,” said George, passing them over.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?” “Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

There were boos and shouts.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.” The trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The goblin wrinkled his nose.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?” “I can’t tell you that,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Tut, tut, tut.

Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone ... he had been talking to Wormtail ... plotting Harry’s murder. . . . Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.”  “Why?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow?” “Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.” She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

But he knew it was too late.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!” But a reckless rage had come over Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

A symbol that links  Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Everything looked so strange, somehow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

...” They set off up the High Street.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He stared at Riddle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“That bit didn’t work out.” The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read: MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named either.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“And we’ve got tomorrow.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“How’re we going to get there?” he asked them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Remember last week?
Expected: 7

...” “Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron angrily.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What am I supposed to be looking at?” “At the — there, between the shafts!
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 4

I want to die!

Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”  CORNELIUS FUDGE Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Snape must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I come from a distant land.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

How much had he heard?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point).
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s pudding.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Dunno,” said Harry dully.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I’ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I was asked to give you this.” “Thanks ...” Harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes, that would be it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I’ll go through first with Harry.” Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and apparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Here — ” He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,” she told them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said gruffly, clambering to his feet.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I forgot about that!” Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He’s been branded with the Dark Mark.” Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said Professor McGonagall to the champions.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it... For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred and George said no one’s ever gotten into it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said Hermione tentatively.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...” Harry’s stomach turned over.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

And Harry’s heart began to race.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Pumpkin juice?” “Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“My name is Professor Trelawney.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Dumbledore joined them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

...” “I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,” said Hermione seriously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Cornelius just sent it...
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“W-what are you d-doing?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

... And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

If we’re not careful, we’ll have another Head Boy in the family.

The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were  tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“You can speak to us together, or not at all.” Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in a long time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“ ’E cannot compete.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?” “What did you say?” Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“IT’S IN HERE!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Remain silent — I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Neither can live while the other survives.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I’m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s seen, it’s not surprising.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

She was not the only person acting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew steadily nearer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry and Ron looked at each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance.
Expected: 3

“They keep slipping in snide comments about you.
Expected: 5

The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen.
Expected: 2

He mustn’t wake the Dursleys.

Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been anything since ... Oh, hi, Hermione!” Parvati positively beamed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I’m takin’yer all back up ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down ter see me after dark again.

“Did he now?” said Aberforth.

“That wouldn’t have been effing difficult ... bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I?

“They don’t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell them.” “You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!” Seamus snapped at him.

...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect.

Actual: 5

Oh, Harry ... you’ll have to be really, really careful.

A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray.

The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.

“Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but — ” “Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he wished it were.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The tank rose into the air and tipped.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry, however, was looking past them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

You see, Remus?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Oh hello,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Nobody else said anything.
Expected: 5

“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.

It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.

Actual: 4

“It’s all my fault.

The same process started again.

“What?” she called back.

On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 54.

“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Why?” He had his answer ready.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I’m not a freak,” said Lily.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They zoomed through it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

So he can come back, right?” Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o’clock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Tri- wizard Cup and Cedric’s body.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages without owls.” Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!” he hissed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

...” “But then — ”  “Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Never.” “Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“But Harry Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

‘Tm going to bed too.” He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him.
Expected: 5

— told me Peter had left blood on the sheets.

“Well need water.

“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence — ” “Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him — ” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and plunged on.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“No,” said Dumbledore simply.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“You know where Dumbledore is, then?” “Well ... no!” sobbed Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated spiders.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Oh, hang on — password.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.” “Doesn’t your dad like magic?” “He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But Harry beamed at her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get to know ’is family properly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“That’s chess!” snapped Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“How else did he get out of there?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

. . and he wants to reserve something in there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,” he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“There’s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?”  Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Ron nodded and left.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...” And he walked away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, “you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Sees Dark wizards everywhere.” Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,” he said quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“There,” said Snape harshly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Oh, very funny ... It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.” Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

And Harry too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Aragog!” it called.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He looked as tired as they felt.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Rookwood’s just told him Bode couldn’t have done it...” “Done what?” “Remove something.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father.

Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have  exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination.

Actual: 7

Come on.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Let me explain.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“I think I know what this means — open this one first!” Harry ripped off the brown packaging.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Bagman stared at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“On what grounds are you attacking him?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

No!
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Everybody looked around.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita’s book.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars — He couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body.
Expected: 5

“Anuthinq.
Expected: 1

“My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
Expected: 1

Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever.
Expected: 4

He couldn’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.

Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy- learn course.

For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters.
Expected: 6

In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“You’ve had ten days to finish it — ” “I only need another two inches, come on — ” The bell rang.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an  extremely pompous guard dog.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Stand back, Harry.” Harry retreated to the sofa.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“We were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?” “Trying — to get — through this damned — door!” shouted Amycus.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Hagrid’s just sent this.” Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I got a rough job.” He drained his tankard, set it back upon the table, and got to his feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him  packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You wouldn’t want to cross him.” Krum grunted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Clunk.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthfull) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We only need to be a few months older.” “We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,” said Lee, grinning broadly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” said Snape.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He kept saying stuff was his fault.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“It’s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.” Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em anymore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Yet unless Ron was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — Ron could not see it at all.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“We’re your guard, Potter.” “We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Inside m-my head ...” Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Phineas.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“A giant!
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

This wasn’t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“What else could I do with it?” Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Hermionel” Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Norbert!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,” said Mrs. Figg.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune- telling never held him exactly spellbound — though he couldn’t help thinking about what she had just said to him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“If you would kindly gaze into the Orb.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake ...” The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

And then he understood, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious — Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Lee was still commentating.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Sorry, Molly.” The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Let me bring him to you.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

I thought we’d start today with a little quiz.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“He’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?” To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“But this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny that.” “No, I can’t,” she answered slowly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won’t be able to handle them,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Everyone’s head turned toward it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I’m back in the country and well hidden.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Look — ” He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim- looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

...”  “But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, “won’t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?” “Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s partly why we’d like — ” “No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It used to be us ... me and Remus ... and James.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Good luck.” Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“First years in front ... no pushing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Yes, I am.” She nodded slowly, solemnly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I’d already know... “Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The basilisk’s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He certainly looked unhappy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Well, how about those autographs, then?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“And I hope it teaches you a lesson!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... And that’s how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it with our nicknames.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I don’t believe it!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

... It’s an insult, frankly, an insult.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd- looking man.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts — Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Harry, what happened?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I feel really full, don’t you?” Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ginny looked as though she couldn’t find the right words.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall’s office when she came marching along the corridor behind them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down upon them with his palms.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Harry, the time for Disarming is past!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“C’mon, Harry... We need ter keep together now...” It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which  Hagrid marched as easily as though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione’s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Voldemort’s lipless mouth was smiling.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Draco Malfoy looked at him.
Expected: 1

“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.

“Did you see them?

“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably.

Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him.

Harry stared at her.
Expected: 6

“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.

“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard.

At the same  instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.

Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel — “Impedimental” he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.

“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!” Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated.

Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.

He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school.

Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.

There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand.

Where does he keep going?” “He’s ill,” said Lily.
Expected: 7

Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole  Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“How come you’re not at practice?” “It’s over,” said Ginny.

As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms.

And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?” “Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.
Expected: 7

And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle.

There was a rushing in his ears as though of water.

“Well ... yeah,” said Harry.

Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not.

Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline: EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE by Rita Skeeter Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read: Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban.

The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar.

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?” “Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her.

Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops.

He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.

He followed.

Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes — next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small — As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped.
Expected: 2

“I thought he’d have cured it by now, though ... or Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.” “It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression.

“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.” “HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and  overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed.
Expected: 3

“Sorry — I — ” “Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.
Expected: 6

“Well, Harry, I’d better get back to work.

“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood excitedly.

At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long- winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.

He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.

Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind.

Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices.

Harry scrambled back behind the fountain, and one of the goblin’s ears went flying across the room.
Expected: 5

Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut.

Nightmares?

Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He had written only two words: It’s hatching.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry’s feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

They’ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve stopped making them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Bagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.

Actual: 2

I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.

She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it ... just the once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

... yes, I owe you .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I think he’s really looking forward to it — well, it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when you mention it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I must not tell lies.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

You know why that was.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?” “No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn’t have it with him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Are you, you great ugly brute?” It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand this any better than he did.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Did you have a good Christmas?” “Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — ” “I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the error of their ways.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I watched Potter run into the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“They’ve always said only prats become prefects... Still,” he added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He nodded slowly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

...” They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

"... yes — look!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“He must have been held up at — oh!” They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s voice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.” “Excellent!” said Harry happily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

George?
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Do you understand me?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?” She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“We just heard ourselves leaving.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You-Know-Who’s mind, then!” “I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...” He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” Harry felt himself go red.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

I — well, I was cornin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an’ I overheard ’em talking — well, arguin’.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” he finished.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“That’s good,” said Ron fervently.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Then he ran down the dark corridor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“See yer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

And you’ve been carrying them around ever since?
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...” “Lies!” “Please ...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I see ...” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Is it Harry Potter?” “I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Who’s that?” said Fred.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

In the tournament.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry was reading the notice through again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“All right,” said Hermione coldly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire — ” To Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

There were also two broomsticks up there.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

There is nothing Dark about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Easy?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Oh .
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“C’mon ... gotta get yeh outta here.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The white stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a weathered look.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming “You solved it!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Come on.” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and- orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I mean, Binky didn’t even die today, did he?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.” It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Snuffles,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

She’s still Ron’s sister.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We have much to be thankful for.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us giving our names.” “People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Come on, you lot.” They followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,” said Dumbledore simply.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George’s jokes, stared at it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born.” He drained his goblet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Fascinating  creatures, phoenixes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The whole thing had happened so quickly Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“And did the voice say who was there?” “No, it did not,” she said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“How was it?” Harry considered for a moment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I wonder why he’s ... ?” His voice tailed away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s only teachers that can dock points from Houses, Malfoy,” said Ernie at once.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t help grinning even though his Seeker was injured.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood’s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“So?” “So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Muggles wear them.” “Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.” There was silence as Harry digested this.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is...” Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Harry swung round.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Harry Potter must stay where he is safe.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!”  The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Oi!” Ron called after her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid ’s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“It hurt.” The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

She was undoubtedly a very good flier — she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since!
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The longer you talk,” he added softly, “the longer you stay alive.” Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.” “The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It was humming slightly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Lupin nodded.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

You’ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.” Ron yawned pointedly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Now, let’s see.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?” “Just that one,” lied Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Please?”  Hagrid’s nose was gently dripping blood.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You think you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... I’ve been stuck inside for a month.” “How come?” asked Harry, frowning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“The flood from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

But while I’ve got you here ...” And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Part of the banisters had been blown away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He thought, for a moment, that he’d walked through the wrong doors.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Bungler if ever there was one.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

The one with the black hair and glasses?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Bill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

. .
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I’m very disappointed in you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I knew it!” “Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Detention!” she shouted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Left here, Harry.” They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Let’s get inside and have a drink.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw  the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Right, follow me!” For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

To Harry’s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a  clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen you.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Is there a problem?” he said, looking between Harry and Snape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“S — sorry?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you won’t like it.” The kitchen was almost unrecognizable.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Mind, I don’t fancy ’is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?” Ernie suddenly shivered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Look at the curtains!
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

1VO!” He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled “ IMPEDIMENTA !” and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach... “What do you think you’re doing?” screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“But the match,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Why don’t you join us in our compartment?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

They are the best — although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.” Harry did not answer.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He had heard it before.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The soup was stone- cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He clanked to his feet and shouted, “Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!”  He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Then — SMASH!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’ hedge.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

. .  he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ... they weren’t going to take him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I’m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Finally Bill said, “All right.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Well have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.” He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.

A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.

He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.

When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams.

“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight.

Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.

“Shall we go down then, Harry?” “Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.

Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn’t like it.

“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.

Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.

Dumbledore sighed.

He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist.

Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment?” Harry couldn’t believe his ears.

Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?”  “Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.

In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.

“Come off it,” groaned Ron.

Would someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come back?

Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand.” “You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ” Percy hissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.

At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.

He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A large bottle was swinging from his hands.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

There was nobody there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood.
Expected: 2

...” “I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Why else  would they turn up here?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Well done!” Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Spotted dick, look!
Expected: 4

Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, “ Dissendium).” and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Is this a confession?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

As he reached the pavement, Harry looked around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight!
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

And he was planning more murders — this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger — Frank knew what he must do.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

ACCIO PROPHECY !” Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Ali Bashir’s on the warpath.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It’s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?” “Well, yeah — ” “Then we’ll help you.” The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be honest,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold.

He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue.

“He used to give me free ice creams.

Her eyes were open too.

Actual: 2

Peter betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down — ”  “THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Now string them together, and answer me this, Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?” Harry gaped at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How could they ever make up for this?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“From London, I think.” He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood “London” to mean “number twelve, Grimmauld Place” by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Well, I’ve got news for you, boy.

A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“But this way it looks more like an acorn.
Expected: 3

“Cissy, wait\” Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape ’s new regime.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He couldn’t ever remember feeling happier.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir — ” “I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

When he turned back to face the room Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Been hoping to run into you!
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“The point is, if we find out you’ve been horrible to Harry — ” “ — and make no mistake, we’ll hear about it,” added Lupin pleasantly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.”  Harry’s heart began to pump very fast indeed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Dumbledore raised his hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He had been so sure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog’s and dazedly consulting his booklist.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Our newspapers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Sorry,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.” “Oh ... yeah ... right,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Something shiny glinted in his belt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to — er — ensure that he didn’t die in vain.” Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Rejoice, for You- Know-Who has gone at last!
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
Expected: 6

The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“My cat!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Come on...” “So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grinning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

... Cedric and Krum hadn’t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken the mersong seriously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He filled it with more potion.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.” “How did he get in there?” demanded Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

What exactly are they?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Now?” “He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were traveling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.” “And Merope?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

They’ve even got the axe ready!
Expected: 3

Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom...
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” “I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry’s hands were numb with clapping.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I don’t know.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s wand share cores.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until — “Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’m not dancing,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Can you see them in your mind’s eye?” “Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was coming next.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES!
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“We all know you can’t get enough of her.” This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!” — The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry shrugged.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see  that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I assure you!
Expected: 4

He reached the door untouched.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Did he dare move his foot?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement!
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Good night.” The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry heard Hagrid ’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I really like you, Harry.” He could not think.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I think he’s avoiding us,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“So .
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your arm?” “What?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song: “Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,  You’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ” “That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?” “No,” said Harry, taken aback.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?”  “Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,” said Ron, but very quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,  joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?” Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, Professor ... that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the headmistress ter decide ...” “Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” said Professor McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.” “Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Okay, men,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“If she’d caught Snuffles ...” Harry finished the sentence for her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

I want your word!” “My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Why d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble?” “What d’you mean?” Harry asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

You fought a man’s fight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“ I don’t want to break rules, you know.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business.” “That’s an understatement,” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes — “Lumos\” he whispered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.” Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ” “Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves  five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ .
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, “is more time.” “But — ” Hermione began.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“See this?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Because they’re here in person,” said George, pointing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Isn’t he cute?” “Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Yes, I’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“More for any who want them!
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

And the child — the child — ” Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

. . like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A wave of piercing cold broke over him — “Expecto patronurrd” Harry yelled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Come on, Harry, I sleep at the — at the top — ” Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.” Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“But she wouldn’t come.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The cat was still there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

TALONS AND TEA LEAVES When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?” “He ...” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Everything was curved to fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the cupboards — and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Let me go!” “They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.” “Whose word?” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Do you really think this is about truth or lies?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione approvingly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?” said Bagman eagerly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“She’s jus’ left.” “Who?” said Ron curiously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“All right?” Harry whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“She must be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It looked oddly familiar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What did you bring her for?” “Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,” Harry panted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Suit yourselves.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Episkey,” said Tonks.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He told Borgin that Grey back was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!” Harry gaped at her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water. . . .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Hagrid didn’t answer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, “D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?”  “Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,” said Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of wizard prison and he’s on the run.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Never dreamed they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Just because he said you were the best student of the year — ”  They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He could not pretend now that he was not scared.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

In the Pensieve!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He swallowed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

That must be why she was — ” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Ickle Firsties!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map to check that the coast was still clear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Where Ve you put the Horcrux?” “In my bag.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

But ve have grounds larger even than these — though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He couldn’t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’ time.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

And the one I just came through — well — it’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there ...” Harry hesitated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

WE NEED THE PROPHECY!” “He dared — he dares — ” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“What do you see?” The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them.

Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch.

I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.” There was an explosion of cheering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Yet this hopeful mood did not last long.
Expected: 6

The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” *  THE FLAW IN THE PLAN He was lying facedown on the ground again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!” Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry: some of them smaller, others larger, than life.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him like that.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.” “Ah,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“So noble!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a  winding cobbled street.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I am not such a coward.” “No,” agreed Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the ... ah ... escape.”  Harry willed Hermione to keep her head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

. . but the house-elves have been warned not to tell ...” He ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“They love it here.
Expected: 2

He was so angry he could hardly speak.

Actual: 7

“We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he  was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that they were dead.” They all stared at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd...” He seized Harry’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?” Harry frowned at Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Long as they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s not.” Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Can I have your autograph?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck.

Actual: 7

“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.” Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I remember it so well.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

. . what did they do?” Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry’s father had told him what to do, how Cedric’s had made its final request.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He was very white, and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“So why’re we stopping?” The train was getting slower and slower.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He saw a glitter of teeth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“We haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out, and began to read.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Nine inches.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Perhaps it was a palace.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

... Good luck.” “Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act — And then many things happened at the same moment.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“It’s faulty — ” Both of them pummeled it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry — do you know her?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I believe Gregorovitch himself started it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Sorry I disturbed you.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted to beat it away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

. . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- Who was mentioned.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

You haven’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me?” “My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Snape looked around at him, frowning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They knocked again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...” But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Only,” said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, “well — I know I’ve been a bit of an idiot — ” One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He ran back down to the common room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He doubted very much whether a book could help him now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.” “How could you tell which one was the Gurg?” asked Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the headmaster will have to listen to me this time.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.” “So what?” She threw him a look of deep dislike.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all  his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he’d beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Very good.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The tunnel turned and turned again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“It’s all about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was a brilliant, sunny day.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“A plot to get this house?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“It’s already heard Fang!” The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to the parchment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily, answering Harry’s unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He was saving his own skin as much as mine.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Those are cursed wounds.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents, well- known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I did!” said Harry indignantly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The minister is very pleased with you.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I suppose Dumbledore’s trying to hush it all up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There was nothing brave about what he did.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly and quietly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You know, just vanish and reappear at home!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He had known all along that he wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E. It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

This struck Harry as slightly odd.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“You just put something in that drink.” “Excuse me?” said Harry.

Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“But she laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do now.” “Which is what?” said Harry impatiently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.” “How can he think that?” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The bond connecting us was broken.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry was getting very good at it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“He trusts you so, Severus.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Why?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Listen, you can help me if you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.”  Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“My old House, you know.” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.” “Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

"... so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.” “I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat beside  the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, “111 be off to the station, then.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort’s ranks...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

That’s only March for me!” “Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle ...” “Not the point, is it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Grindelwald lost control.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Yes, it’s a minute off.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

My dad’s a milkman, he couldn’t believe it either.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“What’s up?” said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Will you come now?” “I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“There — there wasn’t time for him to say anything.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Oh okay,” he said, “no problem.” “I’m really sorry,” she said again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

It means a lot.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a  man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

What if they walk into you?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“My Lord?” said Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.” Harry sat up straight, interested.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

We’ll be back about a week before term starts and we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our new books.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Two things sustained Harry that day.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It was half-past two by the time he had finished it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

A boiling hate erupted in Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Perhaps you’re getting a little drowsy?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“You’ve got exams coming!” “Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,” said Fred.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Shouldn’t be too difficult.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“We will practice the charm without wands first.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave toward the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . . Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“STUBEFY, STUBEFYl” But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Dead.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“But she said you were just going for a drink, you’d be back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Ouch!
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

. . “Here we come!” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“We’ll — er — we’ll go back now, shall we?” Harry and Hermione nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Let’s say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...” “NO!” Hermione screamed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Password?” she said as they approached.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

The wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“They can travel by fire — only you’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ” He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“But I kept my temper!” said Harry, horrified.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for — the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“That’s better,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall’s severe voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

. . but there is no doubt that it was effective...” Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I heard things in Azkaban, Peter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

We’ve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ” “Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Snake language.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“What made you?” “He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He’s going to be okay.

Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The timing was significant.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

This is why!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore’s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet.
Expected: 4

“No!” cried Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’ve got permission!” she said.
Expected: 5

“With brains like yours?” “Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on Gryffindor in the end.

There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And now they knew why it was forbidden.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.
Expected: 7

All eyes were now on Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.” “That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.
Expected: 7

Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A.
Expected: 5

A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW.

“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder.

There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon.

“Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone?

He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter.

“I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve.
Expected: 6

Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round- faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought  up by his formidable witch of a grandmother.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.

He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand.

“NOOOOOOO!” Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself.

He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday.
Expected: 4

“It was a Muggle who saw him.
Expected: 3

There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp.

As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.

His cloak lay ripped on the floor.

Harry nodded.
Expected: 1

“D’you want help finding them?” “Oh no,” she said, smiling at him.

’S like bein’ back in Azkaban — ” He fell silent, gulping his tea.

Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe- inspiring.
Expected: 6

If we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.” “You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved.

“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered.

“Winky is not sunk so low as that!

George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room.

Expected: 6

Harry looked from Ron’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione’s slight frown, and nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He bared his pointed teeth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

All right.” “If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” He looked sober and tired.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

With an effort he straightened  himself in his chair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s stomach rumbling loudly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry’s elbow very hard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on?
Expected: 6

Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him.
Expected: 4

“Let’s see now ...” She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing.

“Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today.

... Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places ... ah, and here’s Lucius!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly.
Expected: 4

In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it.

He didn’t say anything.

But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I was sort of saving it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line,” he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.
Expected: 5

“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter.

Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual.

An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake.” “Whose head?” gasped Hermione.

Hermione ignored him.

“I don’t care.

He pointed Harry toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.” “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn’t blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?

Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.

“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.

Was it true?
Expected: 7

“Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom.

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.

Potty luuuuurves LooooooonyV’  And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!” “Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry.

Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.

Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this.

“She’ll be there in ten minutes.

Expected: 2

He put on a high- pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Ron, how did you — What the — ?” Harry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies.

“Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, ’as there, Ern?

The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.

Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.

“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said.

Their  footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.
Expected: 5

“Cool!” He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.

Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.

“Well, honestly ... ‘the fates have informed her’ ... who sets the exam?

“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s.

“We only need to walk a short way.

Then the sound of a door opening made him look around.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry’s wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers — He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed ... and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldemort ’s wand that was vibrating extra- hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful.

“Dunno why you care.

They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He’s doing you know what!” Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun.
Expected: 2

Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time?

Dad was going frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office — and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up — “But your dad — this car — ” Fred laughed.

The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.

He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him.

“I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?” “Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily.

They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family.

“Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry!

They each  grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.

Never occurred ter me what he was doin’ there.

“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled.

Panic flared within him.
Expected: 7

Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her, grinning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I should have done more.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I mean he’s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his feelings and cry!” “There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty times before,” Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney’s room.

I was sacked three days ago!

“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said.
Expected: 4

The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He dropped his voice.
Expected: 2

He stopped in his tracks, listening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But Dumbledore had overestimated him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“W-what?” Harry stammered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

... Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.” Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“She can’t honestly think I’d wear ...” Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Our cousin!
Expected: 7

“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House team?” said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I don’t dance,” he said quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Know where it came from?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“That’s friendly,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

And you must be Mr. Longbottom!”  Neville nodded, looking scared.
Expected: 6

Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.

She had stopped running.

The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the three of them scrambled back through it.

“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?”  Hermione looked at him in surprise.

“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it.

Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds.

Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He’s bitter.” A clock chimed somewhere.
Expected: 2

“It’s not my fault,” said Wood.

Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed.

The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands.

“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily.

Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.

I may be able to sleep at last.

“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.

He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore a dementor attack.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was the only place he had ever been happy .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And what’s inside it.
Expected: 2

“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

You will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one.
Expected: 5

As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Why had nobody ever told him?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The Dursleys couldn’t possibly be here, could they?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.

“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to understand a word of English.

If Filch really didn’t know ... he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at all.

“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already taken your things up.

“The moment they start trying to move into each other’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told Harry.

“Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though.

“Yeah,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.” “No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood.

“Dobbyl” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed.

Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?” “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

“Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?” “Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing.

“Well bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him.

A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke.

Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn’t had it signed, that was no good.

Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them — With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.

Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves.

Cho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta.

The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant were growing fainter and fainter.

Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room.

Or we’ll stuff it into his hand.

“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees.
Expected: 4

I imagined that people would panic.” “I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.” “You never really tried!” she said hotly.

He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to look at Cho.

As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously.

Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open.

“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.
Expected: 7

He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible.

Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him.

“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible,” she said.
Expected: 2

“I could’ve taken those mer- idiots any time I wanted.” “What were you going to do, snore at them?” said Hermione waspishly.
Expected: 4

“But ... how do you know?” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I don’t know.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled squeak.
Expected: 4

He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.
Expected: 6

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening.
Expected: 1

“Harry’s supposed to stay in school — ” “He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron.
Expected: 3

Didn’t you listen to Ollivander?

“Wood told us.

The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure.

And you don’t have to do end-of- year tests either.

“Harry who?” He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

There was no keyhole or letterbox.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch robes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished.

...

This did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a moment (“Great!

“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once.
Expected: 2

. . and they had been plotting to kill someone else .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings — he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?” Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH!
Expected: 4

Ha haaa!

Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him!

The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“It’s us,” Harry hissed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Or d’you reckon the match is over?” “I don’t know,” said Hermione miserably.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ” “Indeed?” said Snape.
Expected: 3

“Mom?” he whispered.
Expected: 1

Ron had his ear to the door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Porridge?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

And I think, to be safe, this young man’s twin ought to be stopped too — if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well.
Expected: 5

He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.

Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.

Barty’ll be able to sort it out.

“Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling with pride.

“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.” Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.” Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry’s robes with his eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny’s things secondhand.” “Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry asked Ginny.

“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door.

“What do they want photos for, Colin?” “The Daily Prophet, I think!” “Great,” said Harry dully.
Expected: 4

He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Can you believe that?” The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s Head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

On the count of three ... One ... two ... three ...” Harry turned.

Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles.
Expected: 7

“You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.” So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Dark days, Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s defensive jinx.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?” “He’s dead.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth.
Expected: 3

“Is that what you mean?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“How come you haven’t got any cards?
Expected: 2

“I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor.

“Silenciol” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s frog, which deflated silently before them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Macnair!” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then — He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was up to.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What did you go running to McGonagall for?” Hermione threw her book aside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

And now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!” “I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

ARTHUR WEASLEY BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings.
Expected: 7

Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Do you mean — Him?” Malfoy shrugged.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“About Siri .
Expected: 5

She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione ’s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night.
Expected: 1

“What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.” “Losing who?”  “Amelia Bones.

When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished.

“We wanted to ask — ” “I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

This didn’t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
Expected: 1

They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms.

“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves?

“Expecto Patronurrd” A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain — concentrate — A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s robes, reaching for him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

. . and I saw him standing over me .
Expected: 3

The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron sarcastically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“But five minutes only.” And she let Ron and Hermione in.

The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet.

As Harry  passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he didn’t dare go and get it.

The dormitory was empty when he reached it.
Expected: 5

“Ron — are you okay?” “Where’s the dog?” “Not a dog,” Ron moaned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,” said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face.
Expected: 4

“Flint’s just been to see me.

Hermione swayed on the spot.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Well, there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning.
Expected: 6

"... squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.
Expected: 5

The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful.
Expected: 4

Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff.

They took him into a cell near mine.

Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet.
Expected: 2

Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It was always Harry who ...” Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now\ sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“And you’re not either, are you?” Harry shook his head too.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes with her left hand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

They were so busy that Hermione  had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want George to think he was eavesdropping.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Something had moved upstairs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.” He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

How dare you tell such lies!
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket as he went.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

An aisle ran down the center of them: There was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus ...he was a natural.

"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.

“As you can see,” Professor McGonagall told the class while they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, “your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry?

And she was dead in another hour.” Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

And then he heard the whistle blow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,” said Hermione haughtily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It had seven keyholes in a row.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I can see them too.” “Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Hiding, are you?” he said softly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years!
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“I’m in Gryffindor, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It was not moving.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

. . yeah, if that was its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no, a sheep ...” Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I repeat, Mr. Potter ... Where is Sirius Black?” “No idea,” said Harry loudly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming.
Expected: 5

. . the snake .
Expected: 6

Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar.
Expected: 5

“Harry!” squealed Hermione.
Expected: 6

“A what?” said Harry, interested.

He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet anyone.

“I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.” Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“My kind don’t usually breed!
Expected: 7

Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry felt as though he’d received a huge electric shock.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Maybe they need an interpreter.” “Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” Ron asked Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house.
Expected: 6

Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced.
Expected: 5

Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl)  While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets.
Expected: 6

A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.

Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerked open.

And look after Ron.” “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” “Shut up,” said Ron again.

“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione scornfully.

“Sir,” he added.

...
Expected: 4

Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry’s side, doubled up with laughter as  they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy’s team.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Said an incantation, did they?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He did not look back as he closed the office door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“And what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“There’s no point telling him again.” Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.” His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry’s than anyone else’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards.

“He’s a genius!

“Alecto?

Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?” Malfoy’s pale face went slightly pink.

Harry couldn’t sit down.
Expected: 1

“Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.” Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it.
Expected: 2

Take your seat.” Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains.

He’d die.” They looked at the dragon.

“Harry, he was a Death Eater.
Expected: 4

“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And no one’s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

This was where he, Harry, had seen him...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Crookshanks ’s fur suddenly stood on end.
Expected: 3

Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“How are things at your house?” Lily asked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.”  Harry spun around.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I thought I was collecting information for our side!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

No need to ask who you are.

Actual: 4

The monster in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant serpent!

Harry stepped out behind him.

My — our — one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building.” “So he only heard ... ?” “He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort.
Expected: 5

“I was there, I saw it.

“It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.”  Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Yeah, loads,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

In a front pocket were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B.

Harry had never seen her looking so happy.

“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged  again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Another few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Her face was completely bloodless.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Hi, Hagrid!” he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Precisely.” There was a pause.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last — The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light.
Expected: 7

“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty- five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk.
Expected: 6

Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermione, shaking her head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Scrimgeour ’s expression hardened.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...” Just then, the front door slammed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.” Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream ... it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I don’t want to fight anymore!” “I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

. . but he really didn’t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“No!” she shrieked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school — here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered — He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You an’ your dad are finished.” “Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Still, it might be reusable.”  He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Why aren’t you in class?” “I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“You were muttering in your sleep.” “Was I?” “Yeah.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Fred had “rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?” Ron sighed exasperatedly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!” The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“It’s my rat,” he told the witch.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It spoke of a boy born at the end of July — ”  “You know what I mean!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...” “Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“This is cool.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry’s life.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying.”  “Mmm ... you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?” said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes.
Expected: 4

“Ah, ’Agrid ... it is time?” “Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.

They can die, as long as you have what you want?” Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He knew what to do.

It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin.

Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.

Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: “...I smell blood.

He sprang back respectfully.
Expected: 4

He had to be close now, he had to be.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“You can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them.
Expected: 6

“I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The Great Hall looked magnificent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.
Expected: 5

Ginny didn’t find it amusing either.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore — he’s dead!” The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

All around them, people were asking one another the same question: “How did he get in?” “Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw a few feet away.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“The car!” “What about it?” “We can fly the car to Hogwarts!” “But I thought — ” “We’re stuck, right?
Expected: 2

“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Perhaps you already know it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry’s eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?” “I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

I hoped school would knock some manners into you.” She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?” “St.

Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Oh, don’t you see now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?” “Kreacher — stop, stop!” shouted Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself .
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry’s jaw dropped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Don’t you take that tone — ” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... Up you come, Hagrid ... Well done ...” They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“OH!” “Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s bedside table one evening.

Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.

“Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because they’ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!” said Ginny.
Expected: 4

“Right — yeh can touch him!
Expected: 3

Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.” Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him.

Shacklebolt!

We are talking  about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it.

“Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it?
Expected: 4

A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner — Snape’s office.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ” Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white.

Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

... Well ... is there anything else I can help you with?” “Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.” “Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling.

“In the meantime ... constant vigilance, Potter.

The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov —  The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.” “But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond repair,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 7

Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more  stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It was Ron’s rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — ” “You see, Minister?” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.

Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid ’s arms.

Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.

That’s you.

The little creature on the bed had large, bat- like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls.

Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.

“You’ll be safe once you’re in the grounds,” said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road.
Expected: 5

It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy’s cauldron-bottom report.
Expected: 4

From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall’s cheek.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“And there were near misses, many of them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

But it could have been so much worse.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.” It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t been so serious.
Expected: 3

Harry started unwrapping the shopping.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

This was not Ron’s fault.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him.” “What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron roughly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside — before Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry panted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Drink it ... you’ll feel better ... come on, now, Harry, I need to know exactly what happened.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Thanks, Nick!” They set off up the corridor together.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and classrooms too.

Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Why couldn’t he have the stone now?
Expected: 7

Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Get out of the way, Potter.” “YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Don’t go back tonight.” “Why not?” “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!”  “Well risk it, Sibyll,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently.
Expected: 3

She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed.

It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.

“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it?

Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once.

To speak to you.” “Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you get it.

“Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry.

“You can’t tell me.
Expected: 2

“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Professor Vector didn’t give us any at all!” “Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“This way!” Harry’s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It’s Crabbe, isn’t it?” “Wh — oh, yeah,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
Expected: 2

Her jaws opened wide.

“I deserved zero,” said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — ” “Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” said Harry forcefully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He moved over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We got away.” “Yes,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I warn you — I’m armed!” There was a pause.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.
Expected: 6

Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

We still hadn’t got rid of the cup!

Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I know it’s here somewhere.”  They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead.

“Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be a — a real — ?” He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
Expected: 6

They already have the arrogance of their kind!

The Chosen One’!
Expected: 6

This way, please ...” And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

They live over the shop!” “Yes, but — but — ” Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another problem.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I’m enclosing a picture so you can see.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.” Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once... You were really brave standing up to her like that... She had called him brave... She did not hate him for being alive... Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that...

“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously.

Pure-  blood mother, Muggle father .
Expected: 6

And how about Hagrid?”  “That’d be great,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

What if you’re seen?” “You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I’m an Animagus,” said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,” said Ron reasonably.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth.

Actual: 3

“Shut up,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Dobby did, he left the Malfoys’ to give me warnings two years ago.

Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.

Just some stupid teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously.
Expected: 6

Shall we walk on?” “Professor?” “Yes, Harry?” “Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” “Into it?

“If it hadn’t been for her ...” Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful.

His uncle’s eyes flashed.

It was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life.

“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open.

“Karkus’s,” said Hagrid heavily.

“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!” “No,” said Harry flatly.
Expected: 5

“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.
Expected: 6

Then, spotting Harry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!

Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon.

“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge.” And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth.

Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.

Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing bands, but something was wrong.

Do you know ...” Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry.

“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.

The wizard was eyeing him with great interest.

Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.

It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.

“Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.

Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.

So then I said, Altars Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.’ ” “Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked Hermione.

“I didn’t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.” “We weren’t hungry,” said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.
Expected: 2

He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.
Expected: 7

Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.

“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling.

“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said.

He was exhausted.

Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.” “I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

... Come on, let’s go.” Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, “The dementors send their love, Potter!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.

I have no alternative but to force you.

“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

You saved our lives.”  The barman grunted.
Expected: 7

His aunt was back outside the door.
Expected: 1

“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go!” said Harry angrily.
Expected: 5

“Vot is it?” Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d seen movement.
Expected: 4

“What villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands!

Listen, if I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin — ” “Oh, that’s what you said to it?” “What d’you mean?

“I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!” “Good one,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...”  “You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face.
Expected: 1

They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them.

Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.

“Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job?
Expected: 6

“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Explain yourselves.” It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The tips of Dumbledore ’s long, thin fingers  were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.

“What are we doing here?

I see difficult times ahead for you, alas ... most difficult ...

Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water.

I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time.

Why would your Patronus change?” Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...” “It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice.

“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?” Hermione asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

... That’s it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open.

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists.
Expected: 1

He turned around and found Cho standing there.

“I knew it!

Actual: 7

“Go on, boy, go on.
Expected: 3

He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Knew\ Of course we knew!
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were sitting — right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s Cross .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood everywhere...” “I’m going for help,” said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“I’m sure you are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Outstanding’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.” The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...” “You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Hermione was peering into Fred and George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section?
Expected: 1

“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.

He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.

“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Instant scalping .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

. . but Harry didn’t care ... that was no more than dodging a Bludger.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!” Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like the idea.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He flew higher.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face  and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.
Expected: 2

“My father’s the editor.” “I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

After you, Harry ...” Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Yes,” said Dumbledore.

“It’s leprechaun gold.
Expected: 4

No matter where Harry went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore’s flight, and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.

“He were a head case, that Aberforth,” says Enid Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that time.

“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne.
Expected: 6

Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below.
Expected: 5

“I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.

“It’s part of our new training program.

Ron’s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.

“I was getting really worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters.

It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry’s side.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

... A little disappointing ... but I’m sure you did your best.” Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.” “What?” Hermione looked slightly confused.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his eyes almost shut, “but it looks more like a donkey from here,” he said, leaning to the left.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.” And so he had.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“He had it coming to him,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

How was your exam?”  “Oh ... okay,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

... With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“ALECTO\ If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter — d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?” snarled Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things.

It was hard, just now, to feel worried about anything — even Lord Voldemort.

“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...” He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious .

Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.
Expected: 6

“Good point, that,” he grunted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And, Harry — ” “See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

That’s unicorn blood.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Harry — Harry — what are you doing?” cried Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
Expected: 1

It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.

Be careful.” “Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody, shaking Harry’s hand too.
Expected: 5

Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught it again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“You notice the lantern dangling from his hand?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

. . although Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he had ever expected .
Expected: 7

Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

See you.” Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Nobody has seen it in living memory!
Expected: 7

As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?” “My Lord!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “CrucioV’ Bellatrix screamed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

And that wasn’t all.
Expected: 2

“But if they beat Ravenclaw ...” “No way, Ravenclaw is too good.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Is it the real Mark?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Who’s your father?” “He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical population, I should say.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I think ... we’re nearly ... yes.” Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

She appealed to Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers’ cloaks.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free hand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?” “I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables,’ ” said Ron, frowning.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

She was wearing a triumphant smile.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!” Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid, angrily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry stared.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you — again marking you as his equal.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...” But nobody heard much more.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Or maybe I will ... then she’ll ditch me ...” “Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.”  Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The Potions master seemed unable to look away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

... Trust me.”  Harry stared at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Do zey want us back in ze Hall?” She thought he had come to deliver a message.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Lucius Malfoy — ” Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I thought it was Errol’s fault at first “Who’s Errol?”  “Our owl.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Looking around, he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“But how did they find you so quickly?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“ ‘Get the Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to tell him—” Madam Hooch had joined them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Maybe ... maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.” “Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Snape stared at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Today, Hagrid, you pass.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“No one there ...” “This place is haunted!” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He loves them!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The turban fell away.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ finished, they’d lay off each other, but ...” Hagrid sighed deeply “That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin’ down on the valley.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Not now, anyway.” “We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” More silence followed this little speech.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“You want us to do extra work?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.” And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee!
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Though it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“What else did you take, what else?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Very secret.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Flesh given by a servant.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Your father would have done the same for me.
Expected: 3

Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“If you need help, you know where I am!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Something in Parseltongue.” “But — ” Harry thought hard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Dumbledore’s trusted me.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

How strange.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

But next moment Harry had  begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’ living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.” “And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“What do you want this time?” “To ask you how you died,” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It must end.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“This is really important... Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?” “Well ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“None of you have ever seen such a thing.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Things that were covered up.
Expected: 2

It was half past four.
Expected: 3

Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry — ” “Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Wish we could come ...” “Say hello to him for us!” called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“No chance at all.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“V-very well,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Never.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

KILL HIM!” The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way.

“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?” Wood?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He’d never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and I’m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He couldn’t direct it at all.

But why would he want to kill me in the first place?” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.

“And Hagrid wants us to .

“You’re more important.” “Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.

...
Expected: 7

I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared.

His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back.

“Come in, come in, make yourself at home!” Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions.

“Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.” Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared.

“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout.

“Are you really?” said Hermione.

“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up.

“No — no — not again, please — ” It sounded as though someone was threatening him.

He folded up the  parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned.

“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.

‘This second search of the Death Eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results.

“There, there, Sibyll ...
Expected: 5

“Turning left?” “Big surprise,” whispered Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Ron’s eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I know who the Death Eater is,” he said quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

At last he found it.
Expected: 7

“I know you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!” “The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry.

He also remembered something.

At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
Expected: 2

The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn’t really want to know the name of at the moment.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

What if, even worse, I told you who’d been strangling roosters?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Hops ahead — people follow the light — then — ’ ” The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Well, good-bye!” And he strode away toward the castle.
Expected: 2

“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.” There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.
Expected: 6

So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen  grounds to Hagrid’s cabin.

Harry and Ron choked back laughs.

Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
Expected: 3

Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.

“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!” said Twycross.

“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?”  “Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips.
Expected: 5

All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there.
Expected: 3

He had read these notes only this morning...
Expected: 5

“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“A castle to you.” Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first.

Actual: 3

The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry’s bed.

Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.

Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!” “Drink this, Professor.

She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.

All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls.

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

A second, very small parcel contained a note.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her  copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“It’s you two.” “Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?” Hermione said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

According  to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he — when it happened.

"...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry approached him, looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“It’s the crack of dawn.” “Exactly,” said Wood.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Years and years ago.

Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

...” But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione ’s face that she was thinking what he was thinking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

. . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.” The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yeah ... can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.
Expected: 7

“Please wait quietly.” She left the chamber.

“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but — ”  “Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Why hadn’t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I do!” Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although she followed Hagrid’s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill- wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I do feel the same way.” The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get ’em eager fer more.

Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it.

As much money and life as you could want!
Expected: 1

“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I loved them.
Expected: 7

The dementor’s eyeless face was  barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness.

“You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!” “It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly.
Expected: 4

“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!” “You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow.

“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill.

Harry had reached the shed.

Speaking in” — Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?” “I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He pulled the handle, but it was locked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Well stay with you too, Hagrid,” she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Someone from the Ministry of Magic and — and an executioner.” Hermione looked up, startled.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“And it doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?” “No,” said Harry, getting into bed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“And I reckon he’s the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.” “Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk, “me included.

Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the  doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you know what I must ask you to do.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — Malfoy’s fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval...
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.

“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.

This Snitch” — he held up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your touch, Potter.

Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.

“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Tell you when I see you.

Ron hesitated.
Expected: 7

“Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

How do you think that could have happened?” Harry tried to look mildly surprised.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.” They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues his case properly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

You behave yourself, got me?” “I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They had hit dead ends everywhere.

“Yeah,” said Cedric.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the  topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.

To general indignation, a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled.

Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.
Expected: 5

He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“ — Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose.

He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired.

And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?”  “Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch.
Expected: 2

“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I won’t forget all the help you gave us.
Expected: 3

There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.
Expected: 2

It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides.

Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son.

“Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” “Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted Tonks and Mad- Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the underground.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“So what?” He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Lavender Brown,  Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Ron’s arm.

Actual: 3

And now, you will kindly continue your reading.

“Harry, what’re we — ” “SHH!” Harry strained his ears.
Expected: 2

...” “Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!” The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“All right — squirti” Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle- sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Is that the best one there is?” Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him.

“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said Hermione.

Mad, eh?” “Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” But he broke off.

“What — what are you doing?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s progress through the air.

The skin on the back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long.

Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry.

However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest.

Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam.

“The point is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map.

“If you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation.

He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up.
Expected: 4

Then Professor McGonagall arrived.
Expected: 2

Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House he belonged.
Expected: 5

“What did you do with the body?” “Carried it into the forest.

Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry — ” “They won’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 5

“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, Harry, it’s a start” He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Diffindol” yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Quirrell cursed under his breath.

Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground.

“I’m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time.

Harry felt a great leap of excitement.

Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o’clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.

“Can we move?

The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform.

Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral.

“And guess who I ran into up there?

No dress sense at all.

“It was you!” he said slowly.

“Whatever yeh say, blood’s important...” And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.

Just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be okay!” They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Do you know them, then?” “Well, of course I do!” Harry looked up, diverted.
Expected: 7

It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.” Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle.

“I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir — ” Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.

This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.

The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his  thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green- and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again — “Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.

“Ginny\” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first.

“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third day.

They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I’ll get the drinks, shall I?” he added, going slightly red.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was  distracted at once.
Expected: 7

“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals.
Expected: 2

Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall,  looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.” “How?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”  35 BEYOND THE VEIL Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

A large black and silver volume caught his eye.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Ron grunted in his sleep.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“He lies ...
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Well, Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

All right, I lied!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...”  He sank back beneath the water.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.” “But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?” “Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . “Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and  Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again.
Expected: 6

Nearly everything in here was broken.

Great drops beat on the roof of the car.

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Pathetic,” he told George.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The full story could wait.
Expected: 6

Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends.

Figg’s broken her leg.

Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.
Expected: 6

The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief.
Expected: 7

That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!” “It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly.

NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought.

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.

“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions.

Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck- footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“We wanted to see you.” “We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it.
Expected: 7

Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.

Actual: 7

“But I was patient.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.

“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Don’t be afraid l\ And don’t get in a flap\ You’re in safe hands (though I have none) For I’m a Thinking Cap\” The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.

She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“What’s that thing outside your window?” Harry turned to look outside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.”  And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Nothing whatsoever happened.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’m going to let you down now, okay?” He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Would you like it?”  “I — no — I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean — ” “I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“How’d you do, Hermione?” “Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could answer.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You- Know-Who was after them.

It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.

“He really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?”  “Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.” “I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5

Harry wished he would blink.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Just send notes to me here.

“I’m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.

Harry said nothing.

And here they are: Nitwit!

Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco- nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom.

All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping.

“ Ouch\ Mum — you’re strangling us — ” “I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob.

“He failed to hear the prophecy.

“Can I have a quick word?

How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?

Nobody answered.

Why are you so wet?” “Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off.

“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.

“Did you hear that?

And on the bed next to her was —  “HermioneY’ Ron groaned.

“Get outta my house!” “My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a house?” said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin.

We  will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable facti” And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.

Actual: 3

“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head.

The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away.

“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical.

Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.

By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

...”  “But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to follow him in the first place?” “Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It’s very nice.” “I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.

Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.

Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.

I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.” There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs.

He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood.

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.

The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle.

The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly.

And what about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

I’ll go on.

Harry’s heart sank.
Expected: 6

The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
Expected: 3

Neville followed him.
Expected: 5

He was starting to feel definitely sick now.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

His heart shot upward into his throat.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“That’s what Malfoy said.” “Yeah ...” said Ron slowly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I would not expect you to understand,” he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Why did he have to go red now?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Good night.” Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

How did you do it?”  “I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor McGonagall weakly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Mind you, if all the alleged  sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.” “Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Thieving from the headmaster!”  “They weren’t thieving,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head ... a woman .

“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice.
Expected: 5

Said they’d been bewitched.

It’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge.” This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter.
Expected: 5

“Ah, good, he’s here!”  Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“This isn’t some silly school rule.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“You won’t be needing it,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Are you all right?” said Ron, frowning at her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

She was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught sight of Harry’s face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I’m with Harry.

“Okay, team, let’s go for it!” Hermione ’s spell had done the trick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t remember anything.” “Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.

“No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look — ” He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.

“Beg?

Why do you think you were singled out?” “I ... dunno,” said Ron.

“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione.

“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting.

A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker.

They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.

But now a short, angry wizard stood before  him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to believe that Voldemort could have risen.

Actual: 7

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

No wonder tempers ran a little high.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung inward... Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical clicking.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,” said Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.

Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours.
Expected: 2

Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading TO MASTER, FROM KREACHER.

I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.” I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.

“It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.” Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long  enough to tuck into his belt.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I hope you didn’t waste time down there acting the hero!” Harry felt both stupid and annoyed.
Expected: 4

Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.

Actual: 7

It was Winky.
Expected: 4

“You only like coming down here for the food!” It was an irritable sort of day after that.
Expected: 4

There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry, however, wasn’t feeling cheerful.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door.
Expected: 6

Harry pushed his porridge away.
Expected: 2

“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.

“They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things.

Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t Hermione with you?”  “She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, and — ” But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again: The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill.

“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly.

“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement.

He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark.

This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal.

“Turned it into a Portkey.

...” “Is that right?” said Frank roughly.
Expected: 4

You wouldn’t understand.

He’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.”  The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.

“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone.

“And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it.

She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap.

Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Hang on!” he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It isn’t me!” Hermione ’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.
Expected: 2

“Accio Dictionary !” The heavy book soared out of Hermione ’s hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.
Expected: 4

Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.

Who was the one who wanted his autograph?

Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground.

Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.

Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could be worse.

“I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”  Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.

Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
Expected: 3

He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.

He seemed beyond reason.

We saw him.

Things’ve gone far enough.

Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.

“I opened it to breathe.” “You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said.
Expected: 4

Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.” Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it.

The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders.

“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly okay.” Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried looks.

Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them more than usual before long.” “Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.” “Yeah,” said Harry, grinning.

Harry knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly, and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom.

He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“You is surely Harry Potter!”  “Yeah, I am,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was natural that he should feel protective .
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

... One more sound and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!” He stomped flat-footed from the room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

How long do you think I have?” Dumbledore ’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t believe — ” “LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?”  Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

She’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, his scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him.
Expected: 5

The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.

Dead twins.

“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his tankard.

“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak,  hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown — ” Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes once more and bowed.

“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good time, I mean, it’s extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes.
Expected: 7

He addressed Mr. Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius ’s hands shook.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A different language, I think it must have been.

At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”  “We were hundreds of feet up!

“This is our practice time!

At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.

“Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.” “You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,” he said, observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair.
Expected: 5

They can’t wait to get their hands on this!” She opened the lid.
Expected: 6

Side-Along- Apparition, you know.” “Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like.
Expected: 6

You — you’re — ” Ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione ’s crime, “ fraternizing with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!” Hermione’s mouth fell open.

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.

Harry blinked.

“A girl?” She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.
Expected: 5

Did Malfoy know something?
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.” He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s — stick close, now.
Expected: 6

“They were meddlesome fools, too.” He turned to go.
Expected: 2

He grinned at Harry when he saw him.

“Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” “Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the Slytherins’ efforts to keep Ron and the others under control.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Get up!
Expected: 5

He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day.
Expected: 2

Know what House you 11 be in yet?” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.

His missing tooth had been regrown.

“Who cares?” Harry said.

Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust.

“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket.

Dumbledore was still there.

No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness?

It took a long while to get started next morning.

He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.
Expected: 6

You just don’t like being bad at something for a change!” He had touched a nerve.

“He does not forgive mistakes easily.

Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping.
Expected: 3

Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I didn’t mean to butt in But the wizard didn’t look up.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept.
Expected: 2

“Talking in your sleep.

He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.
Expected: 4

He was turning his head... At first glance, the corridor was empty .
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

But if it was me, I’d want revenge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first- floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Shall we?” Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Where’s Hermione?” “They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

As for Dumbledore’s writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?” “Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

That’s what you want, isn’t it, Minerva McGonagall?
Expected: 5

Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King’s Cross station on September first.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear!” “Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry could hear Hermione’s breathing, fast and terrified.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley.
Expected: 4

“But we can’t follow them now — ” Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the room, holding open the door for Snape.
Expected: 5

“You’re too nosy to live, Potter.
Expected: 1

There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.

“James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.” “We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.

Expected: 3

Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Ron knocked, but there was no answer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

May I introduce you?” He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without looking up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time — ” “I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds!” said Hermione angrily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.
Expected: 6

“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

My curse was deflected by the woman’s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Dad can usually get tickets from work.” This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“You’ll have to stay the night.

None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it.

“There isn’t a reserve Seeker.

He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to read:  Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal- Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo.

Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Mental.” “Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“We don’t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last.
Expected: 2

Do you see what he’s doing, Potter?
Expected: 2

Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

So that must mean ...” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop grinning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yeah, I do,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.
Expected: 2

A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames.

“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I think you’ll be very comfortable.
Expected: 3

Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him.
Expected: 6

“Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Escape?” “A house-elf must be set free, sir.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It’s backfired on you, Riddle.” Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other’s eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will soon be back with us?” Harry turned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

... And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir!
Expected: 4

It was a pair of glasses.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?” “No, Harry, he has not.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Now, please stop badgering me.” To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“And neither do I.” “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry felt very uneasy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Wands only — no contact.

Crack.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

There were luminous rosettes — green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Right ... I’m going down to Hagrid’s.”  “What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I wrote back.
Expected: 2

Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit- pupiled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He unfolded his arms.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“But I can’t ... we can’t ... I’ve got things to do alone now.” She did not cry, she simply looked at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I think he said Malfoy’s dad put it on him...” “Bode was bewitched to remove something?” Ron said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone.” Still, Harry didn’t speak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Why didn’t they hurry up?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“ — mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent — ” “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

That’s great news, really great...” “Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into a chair.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Must have squeezed it too hard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He had a deep, sorrowful voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There was no hope ... no help to be  had.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin... “It’s time,” said Hermione in an awestruck voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Can’t I?” Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?” “I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
Expected: 1

“Lovely to see you again, I must say.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...” “Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long.
Expected: 4

“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It was Cedric all over again, they were just there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry approached, his throat very dry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry listened.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

There he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised arm.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“You keepin’ well, then, ’Arry?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Why so modest, Gilderoy?” Harry gave a start.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The only problem was Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk!
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He ignored Harry completely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said Harry, inventing wildly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Do you trust me, Harry?” Harry nodded.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Mullet!
Expected: 4

There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways .

Seamus handed back Harry’s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A.

But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But I don’t get it — even someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.” “I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He opened his eyes and looked around.
Expected: 7

“Oops — sorry, ’Arry — ” He swallowed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Er — ” Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back.
Expected: 3

“I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?” Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound.
Expected: 6

Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar.

He was never going back.

Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet.

“Lily Evans.

They didn’t look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.” Hermione did not speak to him all morning.

He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire.

He handed over his wand.

Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter.

Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.
Expected: 3

Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.
Expected: 2

Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.

“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House.

“I dunno.”  Ron still looked pale and clammy.
Expected: 7

A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face.

YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM!

The two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right.

Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.

“What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away.

“I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call.

“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it.

He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there.

“I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 5

Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping servility looked convincing.

“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter.

“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.

He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Where did that come from?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He gathered himself for the attack.
Expected: 7

“I’m not wearing that, no way.” “Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly.
Expected: 4

Crabbe stumbled — and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry’s cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.” Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s right.
Expected: 7

“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.
Expected: 4

“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.” Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
Expected: 3

“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” “Your mother died to save you.

According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.” Muriel swigged yet more champagne.
Expected: 7

She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s voice floated out of the window again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I shall need your help.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry was laughing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

This explained everything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He was pale and his eyes were glittering.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don’t know how they got there.
Expected: 2

“What — I don’t — Petunia?” Aunt Petunia said nothing.
Expected: 5

“But, Albus ... surely ... who?”  “The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin.

“There’s something I’ve got to do.

As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting.

He felt just one tiny twinge of regret.
Expected: 6

And last night — ” Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” “Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

We’ve no business staying here.
Expected: 1

“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak.
Expected: 7

Harry lost track of time.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Fine,” said Neville, showing them.
Expected: 1

The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school.

“I don’t know how deep this thing goes.

They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence...” Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.

Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop.

“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying.

“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly.

“Is there anything missing?” Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.
Expected: 2

Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.
Expected: 1

“— two — ” Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three D’s stood for.

“But .

Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But he did all right for a few weeks .
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Shall we go?” Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, and parchment.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“She won’t, she’s got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn’t you see?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry deserves a break.” Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“The fool, honestly ...” She hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

When’re you holding trials?” “I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

They both jumped to their feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry couldn’t see what was so terrible.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.” “Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Right .
Expected: 4

“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you say?” Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat.

They’re going to execute at sunset Nothing you can do.

“What?” said Hermione, joining them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“And also,” she added, as  Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you came to be here.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

This seemed to cheer Ron up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, “There are good things in there, too.
Expected: 2

Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Er ...
Expected: 5

Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“ Really break your leg,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I expect more faithful service in the future.” “Of course, my Lord, of course.

Everybody looked at her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?” “You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his pony.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry approached him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

I shall not, of course, lie.” “Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?” “To see you — look at this!” said Ron, dragging her over to the notice board.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

This time Neville charged forward looking determined.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?” snapped Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Uncle Vernon coughed again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

You realize we’ve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?” Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Get going, then,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Come on,” she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!” She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You’ve already asked her?” “Good point,” said Fred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Lord, is it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She’s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her — ”  “If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again!” Ron said angrily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We’re being flattened.

Sirius’s grip on Harry’s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Oh — oh yeah.” He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket.
Expected: 7

“I have thought long and hard, Severus.

“Harry?” Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood.

“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes.

Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.

“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“You haven’t got a godfather!”  “Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy ’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s — “IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” Neville was in total disgrace.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Strange likenesses, he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause.
Expected: 4

It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

You’re not going to — I won’t let you — ” “Let me?
Expected: 7

Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you?” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

If they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune right there.” The prisoners were dragged to their feet.
Expected: 7

“I don’t reckon I’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take all night.

You’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword.
Expected: 3

Harry looked down at the field.
Expected: 4

Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.

“What the — ?” He gasped.

The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.

“You weren’t being thick after all — you were showing moral fiber!” Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn’t look happy at all.
Expected: 4

“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight.

He had never felt so lonely.

Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor  Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence.

No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.

He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go\” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Potter!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands.

Cedric was pacing up and down.
Expected: 4

“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.
Expected: 1

Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all.

Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.
Expected: 4

“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — ” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.”  Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew’s face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder, sneering in just the same way.

As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.

Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it.

“Perhaps you’d better take the day off!” “No — no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight.

It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people.

After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.

“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief.

Actual: 6

Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes — Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.

Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes.

Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention.

“It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion.
Expected: 4

“You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it.” “So what?” said Harry.
Expected: 4

Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.

Actual: 5

“But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear.

“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron, panting slightly.

He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.

“That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.

Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?” Voldemort did not answer.

Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore ’s pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.
Expected: 2

There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids.

Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
Expected: 2

And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.” The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again.

She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.

Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!” The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock backward and forward.

They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.” Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.

Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were wide and fearful.

He could feel himself shaking.

There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.

“Sir?” he added hurriedly.

Hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.

“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.

It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with something that was like courage.

Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.

“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ” “Bag — right — ” Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it.
Expected: 7

He had made up his mind what he was going to do.
Expected: 2

“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed.
Expected: 7

He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.
Expected: 3

“What?” he said loudly.
Expected: 2

“We need to get into Hogwarts.” “Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.
Expected: 7

This is it, Hermione — ” Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and Harry gave her a leg up.
Expected: 3

“Did you see the Malfoys?” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned.
Expected: 6

It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls ... they just like killing, everyone knows that.

“Is he okay?” Harry asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.
Expected: 6

His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry.
Expected: 2

“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door slammed.

“Ron, it’s me, Harry!” “Harry!

“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered.
Expected: 7

As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering.
Expected: 3

It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack — ” “No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely.

“I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.” Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.
Expected: 2

“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street.
Expected: 4

He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse...

“I don’t believe it,” he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note.

He began to read aloud: “Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all.

He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.

“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.

He merely stood there, looking at Harry.

“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“In fact, the more  impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!” Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.

“Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?” “ Stupe — ” “Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.

Large words at the very top of the tapestry read: THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK  “TOUJOURS PUR” “You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree.

While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
Expected: 1

It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?” said Ron, watching Harry closely.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

None of the faces he could see looked happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being addressed as though they were five years old.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did.
Expected: 4

“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 1

The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.

“What’s happened?” Harry said.

“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said.

Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane.

“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.

He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel.

If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.

“I bet you anything Fudge would’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot.

He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione’s stall.
Expected: 2

He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t hear.

They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all.

It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.
Expected: 6

“The first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.” “I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Presumably they had received a shock from the change of position, just as he had... And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“What a surprise,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

Harry looked around as they entered.
Expected: 6

Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry!

There was a long and painful silence.

“He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it.

But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.
Expected: 1

“Tha’s it, Harry ... now, bow Harry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told.

“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has ...” “I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing, “because I’m already going with someone.” “No, you’re not!” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It’s forty-ten, forty- ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle...”  Harry could hear Luna’s ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was nothing, they could pull back easily.
Expected: 5

“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Harry desperately.

Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves.

Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof.

“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.

Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do.

“So ...

Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin- made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly  it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.

“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs.

“Wow.

He could see the High Table properly now.

“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded.

They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.
Expected: 7

“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!” “Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Then Dumbledore said, “Please explain why you did this.” It would have been better if he had shouted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” A cold smile curved her lips.

Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.

“Ouch — look, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird — ”  The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk.

“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry ... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would  have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.” “Er ... right,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Oh, but — ” Hermione began.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us!

In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.” “Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming!

Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger;  he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.
Expected: 2

They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Miss Granger, you know the law — you know what is at stake.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Then she’ll be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry.
Expected: 5

“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can!

“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again.

“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie.

It’s nothing, really, I’d just rather — ” Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.

Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.

The ghosts didn’t help, either.

Is it Harry Potter?

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him.

“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly.
Expected: 2

Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them, Fred and George’s windows hit the eye like a firework display.
Expected: 6

"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus ...” “Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy.

The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.

Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room.

The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints.

“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented ... at posing.

“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.

“Up to the tower — come on!” The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again, high as the top of the West Tower.

“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him.

“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.

Then you can come back in.” Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.

Marvolo’s ring had gone.

The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane.

After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W.
Expected: 4

“How are you today?” “Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.
Expected: 5

That’s the whole point, you know — international magical cooperation!” To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat.

Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave.

All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin overcoat.
Expected: 4

But some don’ understand that.
Expected: 4

There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed.

“HARRY!

He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and it crashed open.

He looked down into it, expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin — and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.

Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish.

They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable.

“Is this it?

Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle.

“Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle — ” They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot.

“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him.

“House-elves don’t want sick leave and pensions!” Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.

When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort’s laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

... “You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.

The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances.

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” “ — yes, their son, Harry — ” Mr. Dursley stopped dead.

That’s what we should have done ages ago.

Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.

What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.

But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter,  the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them.

Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.” “They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.

“What are you doing?” yelled Cedric’s voice.

Silly little girl, am I?

What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it?

“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly.

... Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed.

Dumbledore was now  stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.

You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble.

He didn’t think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.

It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution — that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials.

White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart- stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.

“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?”  “Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.

Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.

As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.

“I’m not talking about big articles.

Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.

It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs.

Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
Expected: 2

“It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face.

The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore ’s wand.

“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets?
Expected: 2

“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke, “if you want to — er — what is it?” (He checked Percy’s letter.)

“We’ve got to stay for the wedding.

“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed.

Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“... makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
Expected: 3

“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out.

Five points from Gryffindor.” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.

I revolt you.

Harry and Ron stared at each other.
Expected: 4

...” It wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured.
Expected: 2

Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching  him for lack of tact.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

It was I who sent you the Firebolt — “Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

As he opened it he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“How is he?” said Harry.
Expected: 4

LUNA?” “Harry!” Hermione screamed.

“Maybe it’s shy.

I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.” At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above.

Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.

“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was no easy task.
Expected: 2

“It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
Expected: 4

“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.
Expected: 2

He gritted his teeth and knocked.
Expected: 2

We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.” Harry grinned.

“It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently.

“Why is he with you?

“I just wish I’d asked you sooner.

“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.

When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job.

“Very fishy,” said Fred finally.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much louder.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What’s that?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Why?” Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.
Expected: 4

This was supposed to be good training for later life.

There was something hard inside the pillowcase.

His little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand.

Mind you, she’ll go crazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three days’ time.

Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I just thought you ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case.

“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment.

“If it was something that serious, they’d tell someone.

“She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.” “You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said Hermione, closing the newspaper.
Expected: 5

“Naturally, the loss is devastating.

He let his gaze drift over his surroundings.
Expected: 7

Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.

Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his badge.
Expected: 3

“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” said Ron, returning to his copy of A Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“It’s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.” He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snow-flecked eyebrows.

“Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir.

The old goblin seemed to recoil a little.
Expected: 7

He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen ... he had become Hogwarts champion ... he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming ... he had just won the Triwizard Tournament.
Expected: 4

If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!” “I don’t know.

His face fell.

Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.

People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw.

It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once.

“And Hermione’s done four feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.” “Where is she?” asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.

“But ... are you sure?
Expected: 5

. . ah, yes .
Expected: 4

“What?” said Harry, startled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.” “What is it?” said Harry urgently.
Expected: 2

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Cedric shook his head.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ...” Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid’s.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Don’t go biting off more than you can chew — ” “So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione’s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.
Expected: 2

The huge eyes blinked and vanished.

It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.

We saw what happened.”  “Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?” said Harry.
Expected: 2

“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him — ” said George.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 0, rice pudding ... As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a  new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.

Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.

“We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry.

Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But I knew what I must do.
Expected: 2

“ ‘Spew?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it.
Expected: 4

Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night.

Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts’ Charm Breakers once, and called me ‘a long-haired pillock’?” “Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.

I’m glad they did.

Look!

“Are you going to tell us — ?” Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort’s snake...
Expected: 5

Everyone knows that’s the mark of a Dark wizard.

"... and none will come after ...” said the figure of a young woman.

Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler.

Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” Harry handed the flute over.

“Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ” “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles.
Expected: 3

“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
Expected: 3

He wasn’t going to obey Voldemort ... he wasn’t going to beg.

“I’d love some,” he replied.

“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly.

The smell of the forest filled his nostrils.
Expected: 7

Then something closed tight around his neck.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next.

The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer. . . . Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation.

“Ready?” he called.

Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge.

The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.

“I’m no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing.

Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.

“Well, here we go.” Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then — He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes.
Expected: 6

“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.
Expected: 2

“We need to penetrate the inner place.

And is it working well?

Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: My Sweetheart “Nice,” he said.

“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord.

“And what about the Beaters?” he asked, trying to keep his voice even.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up.

“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . .

“So he wouldn’t even tell you who’s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?” “I don’t think he could,” said Harry.

“Er — are you sure this is the right way?” he asked her pointedly.
Expected: 5

Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s robes.
Expected: 3

“What is it?”  “It’s ... him ...” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine.

He stared through his binoculars.

Hagrid looked stunned.

A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin- bags just inside the broken gate.

“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall ... and ... ah.” Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of  candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him.

Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!” “Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road.

Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side.

“Wha’ was tha’ about?” roared Hagrid.

“Having a last meal, Potter?

Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations.

Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.

“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.

Then Ron said, “Let’s get out of here.” “Shouldn’t we try and help — ” Harry began awkwardly.

Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.
Expected: 1

And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — “Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.
Expected: 3

The only person in there was Viktor Krum.
Expected: 4

It was plain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

As Harry shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ Voldemort cried, “Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn’t have released it if he’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold.

Harry squinted around through the darkness.

“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry bossily.

The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.
Expected: 5

“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — !” “ — because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
Expected: 6

“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the message over Harry’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.

She had been  Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric’s death...

“How did you do?” “I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.

There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup.

I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.” Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s face, Harry went on, “I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing.

“What’s going on?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

“I don’t know if there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even.

Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a happy practice session.

“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes.

“How would you say that’s affected you?” “Er,” said Harry, yet again.

“Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter.

“Goodness.

. . never .
Expected: 2

How is that fair, how?” “I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.” Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch.
Expected: 2

I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won’t answer.

The door creaked open.

“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this evening?” said Harry, watching her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.” Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh.
Expected: 6

“We’ve come to take you home with us.” “But you can’t magic me out either — ” “We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning.

O.W.L.S Ron’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup was such that he could not settle to anything next day.

In fact, I wish you’d invite loads and loads of people to come and see!

I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it  out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast.

“Or both,” said Harry.

I’ve known it for years.” He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not.

Why wasn’t he at the Halloween feast?”  Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party.

“Really great.

The train rounded a corner.

I’m not worried at all.

The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words.
Expected: 6

He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Help me, Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest.
Expected: 5

When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver.

A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.

“I care,” said Harry.
Expected: 6

But never mind that now.” He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
Expected: 6

And having funny turns all over the place — ” “I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore coolly.

Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.

Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table.

Expected: 5

Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.
Expected: 4

A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Not scared of him, are you?” “You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him.
Expected: 5

“I knew he’d come after me!

“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!” she told him.

“Yes!” said Karkaroff.

“I’m guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?” she said.

The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs ...” Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window.

Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.

Harry peered out of the window.
Expected: 1

“I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it?

It wasn’t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.
Expected: 4

His insides were squirming.
Expected: 5

“Yes?” asked Harry.

He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow.

Then there was a scream.

Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.
Expected: 4

“I haven’t done it either!” “Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!” “Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face anxious.

“We know Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” There was another thud.

“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding.

Fail to act — and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” “Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away.

He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen.
Expected: 4

He shook his head.

He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady.

Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.

“The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.” “You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was coming — as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room.
Expected: 7

Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Go on,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Another student?”  She closed her eyes and nodded.
Expected: 7

Harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too.
Expected: 5

His office had been almost completely stripped.

“If they were found ...” “Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron.

“Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.” Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
Expected: 6

Play to your strengths, Harry.”  But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch.
Expected: 2

Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood — an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.

“Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello.

But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.
Expected: 5

“Er,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched  the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and protection, and into my waiting arms.

“Remember, Harry?” “Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry.

It is nice of you to have come to see him — “Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, “actually, we were just — er — ”  But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble mutter of “going to have a cup of tea” trailed away into nothingness.

“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on — ” Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds.

When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?”  “Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.

Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd.

He knew who he thought it had been .

“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.

He handed over  his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.

Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap.

Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.

Why didn’t you tell us?” “I’m a what?” said Harry.

“A house-elf!

“We’ve got to hold on to each other.

You will collect the pus — ” “The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.

“Ouch!” The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers.

“He’s got so many little friends, he’s so popular ...” Harry repressed a snort with difficulty.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...” Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree.
Expected: 4

... Dobby is a house-elf — bound to serve one house and one family forever.

“That was Bertha as I remember her at school.” The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore’s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking.

“My dear friends,” he said mournfully.

“But — but the password!” “He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly.

“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.” They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.

By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation.

Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs —  Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it — “Cedric!” Harry bellowed.

As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.

“Are you sure?” “Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four- poster.

Harry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier.

Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
Expected: 6

“You do care,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5

“I don’t care what he’s done!

The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight.

“We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.” “But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former Prime Minister warned me — ?” At this, Fudge had actually laughed.

Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron.

Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class.

Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.

It’s possible.

“Pitiful,” said Fred.

In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry’s insides had become glacial.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Just standing here and watching it happen?” He hesitated.

“Did you know?” he whispered.

Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.

Well meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.

Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other’s fingers.

Harry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought.

“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed.

The only times he’d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been faced with a real snake.

But it is my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic.

“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.” He couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Be careful, Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.” “No problem,” said Harry.

The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh?

“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.

“Professor — ” Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet.

His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.

“Bet it tastes disgusting.” “Add yours, then,” said Hermione.

“I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!” “I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still.

“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely bright voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 2

“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly.

“Is he mad?”  Hermione checked her watch.

Because you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried!

“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper.

“What’s wrong?

Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn’t have his cloak.
Expected: 3

“But who cares, we’ve got what we needed — ” “He is not a brainless git,” said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library.

Actual: 7

You don’t mind maroon, do you?” Dobby was delighted.

They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron’s house.
Expected: 2

“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past.
Expected: 7

“I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, isn’ it?

“Where?” And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face.
Expected: 2

But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister.

Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.

“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.

However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away.

Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, “like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods.

“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.
Expected: 2

Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards.

“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts.

Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The witch’s eyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Codswallop, in my opinion.

“I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.” Hagrid ’s smile faded off his face.

“We’re getting there!

You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and — ” “Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry.

Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s fate that seemed to worry people most.

“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his potato.

They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him.

“You’ll be a proper- sized man, Dudders, like your father.

The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything.

“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark.

“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be “serious.” “Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said Lavender fretfully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.

“Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.

However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.

All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed.

From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only just started it.” “Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

But there was a mouth ... a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle.

Actual: 7

“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

“Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ”  “They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Everyone’s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — ” Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.

He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.

Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a hippogriff.” The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag.

As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure.

“No!

But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic.

It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.

It was driving them nuts.

“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty.

Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters.

Just pack some clothes.

Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch.

“No more, please, no more ...”  Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin.

“Another attack,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The neat fields had gone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?” Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.” “That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behavior.

Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying.

Come, Severus, there’s a delicious- looking custard tart I want to sample — ” Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It was dank and dark.
Expected: 5

There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy’s head poking out of a window on the second floor.

The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.

Actual: 7

“Of course ... healing powers ...

“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.

Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“ Fascinating !” he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone.

It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.

“If only Dumbledore had come with us ...” “Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry bitterly.

“You hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them, Draco,” she said.

There was a bang like a gunshot, and the floor trembled.

He looks bad...” “Thank you,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.

And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You  know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon politely.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock.
Expected: 3

“Harry, Harry, Harry.” Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.

Actual: 6

It was Wormtail.

Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run.

There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen.

He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark.

Harry passed on.

He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair.

There weren’t many people left now.

Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.
Expected: 2

Instead he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.

“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down.

Harry didn’t sleep all night.

“And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them.

I’ve still got four hundred and twenty- two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?” Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Ron’s set was very old and battered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry wasn’t surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute writing.
Expected: 4

“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied.

“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.

As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake.
Expected: 5

Is he really, Fred?

He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage.

“By a herd of centaurs.” “And they left you behind?” asked Ginny, looking astonished.

He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control — Green jets of light shot past them again.

“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he asked awkwardly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.

You only got a scratch!

“Are you up yet?” she demanded.

As quickly as you can, please!” Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.

“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.” Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers.

THE SECRET RIDDLE Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.

Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.

Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk.

No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn’t acted of her own free will.

He nearly died doing it.

It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the  castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.

Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.

There were mountains of cakes and flagons of  pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.

All the best, Hagrid It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more broadly than ever.

She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.

Seven inches.

And the glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable — ” Someone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle.

“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently.

“Precisely!” said Dumbledore.

I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get out of here.

“However, I  do not deny that her information was invaluable.

You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died.

Lost, you take my word for it.

“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.
Expected: 4

“Okay ... how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Stand up, Potter!” Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them.
Expected: 5

“Dumbledore’sArmy.” Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge.

Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all.

Several people nearby screamed.

“Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron’s face.

I don’ know what I’ll do if he ... if he ... We’ve bin tergether so long.

... Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.” Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked.
Expected: 7

The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.” “Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“That is — I don’t know — is a man alive if he can’t be killed?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on .

It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.
Expected: 2

Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.

Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.

I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — ” “But — ” “ Listen to me, Harry.

“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody.

It’s for the joke shop.” “He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.

“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon’s large, purple face.

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair.

“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast.

“He threw me out of his office!”  “I am aware of it,” said Dumbledore heavily.

Then something clunked into place.
Expected: 5

“ Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry.
Expected: 4

... My knife ...” “There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry firmly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It’s a bit odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing — ” She dropped her voice, staring at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks.
Expected: 2

GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!” Harry made up his mind in a split second.
Expected: 3

His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

You’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry.
Expected: 6

“I was lost — Floo powder — ” Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands.
Expected: 2

She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“He’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor is all — ” “He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,” said Magorian quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said Hagrid, looking concerned.
Expected: 4

Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned.
Expected: 5

“I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.” She had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback.
Expected: 7

I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket — ” “The what?” Harry muttered.

There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual.

Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling.

They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze.

Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before.

...
Expected: 7

Hags?

She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.

Harry didn’t even have time to turn around.
Expected: 2

The silence spiraled horribly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!” Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter.
Expected: 7

There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear.

“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, waving at them as she left.

Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.” Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver  hair, beard, and mustache.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

So did Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Or I thought I did.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry wasn’t listening.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Once my name’s cleared ... if you wanted a ... a different home ...” Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry was not even sure that it had really been there.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He must try that in the morning. . . .
Expected: 7

“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that cloak,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 4

As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.

Expected: 6

“You’re in trouble, you are!
Expected: 6

This is money?” “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.

Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Finishing off the Horcrux.
Expected: 7

Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He noticed that her hands too bore the marks of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout!
Expected: 3

“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him the same thing, so ... um ...” It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late.
Expected: 6

“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all.
Expected: 3

If it had not been for the D.A.
Expected: 5

I have, of course, been  following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely — as, of course, I knew you would.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Say something.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television program.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I got there first.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

But then he heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me.

Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He lost track of time.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“You have to pass a test to Apparate?” Harry asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley said after a few seconds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had sat down.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Blimey ... No wonder they don’t look too happy these days.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.” “Tha’ was ... tha’ was ... beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“About time, too,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape ’s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?” “Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily.
Expected: 5

The crowd was cheering harder than ever.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Our kind like the dark and the quiet.
Expected: 2

They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, “Cattermole!”  They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over.

They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.

“Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing.

To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Haven’t you told your friends about your parents, Neville?” Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook his head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You have to keep him tied up?” said Hermione faintly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . .
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry, however, little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Let me see, let me see ... ,” he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though  he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

. . will set out ... to rejoin ... his master.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

People aren’t too keen ter take it on, see.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry’s dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys’ roof.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

You actually fainted?” Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Beech-wood and dragon heartstring.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore it.

At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike.

“Eet ’as been too long!” As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“What do you mean, ‘’e was going to be married?’ ” Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep ...” He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking ... Why was the name “Gregorovitch” familiar?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Harry shook his head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was very amusing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husband.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

She said something about that Ron Weasley.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

You are regretting that you ever returned to me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...” He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

And I felt ... as though all happiness had gone from the world .
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said Ron, astounded.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Owls .
Expected: 1

Harry’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Second one killed this term,” he explained.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I’m going back to bed.” “Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“But think ... think what he did.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

My youngest brother!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Here ... we ... are ...” she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

. . It’s gone wrong, he thought .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The small eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed together with sleep.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might have happened then.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”  ayue NINETEEN YEARS LATER Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” The giant chuckled.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S- bend of a toilet three floors below.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But ... “Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things he’s stealing — ”  Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I didn’t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.” “It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

On Madam Hooch’s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He was called Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.” “I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron uncomfortably.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Have you got him?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“I’m just thinking ... remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He noticed that her hand  shook as she pointed at his shoulder.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from  what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry turned back to the others.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Surpassed itself, hasn’t it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry, Harry, Harry.” It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” “The floor?” Harry suggested.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they healed over seconds later.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall ... unless you’re supposed to put the spell on yourself?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

You don’t know what it’s like here.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“No, no ... best we know where you are.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Harry!” said Fudge jovially, moving forward.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Where are we?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“ ‘Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?” “Yes,” said Harry again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I thought you’d say They were young.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Ron was admiring the cloak.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Bagman is a bad wizard!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They’re in a fury against Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle grounds.” “I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall sharply.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Vanished.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

But you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But he was home.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!” “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“ T3ye, then, Potter,” said Moody, grasping Harry’s shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Take the curse off him, then!” James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the countercurse.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I could tell.” Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Hi, Neville.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Hermione’s there as well!”  Hermione nodded, beaming.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“You’ve missed your chance.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

But then the music stopped, and he turned to face the front again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Frank!” cried several people.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“No one regrets more than I — ” “You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said Fred.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a grin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating on them at the moment.” “What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“No,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he’d been in here.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Let us in and we can take it off.” “Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”  “So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...”  Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“He-here?” said Fudge.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixteen years’ devoted service...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.” The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

I need to speak to the driver, excuse me ...” He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

When you are older .
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“They’re not arguing anymore?” “Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

What can he do about it?” “That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“About what happened to him?
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

You will be taking a Portkey.” He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Bertha Jorkins.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

. . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

... ‘Mudblood,’ he called her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding world!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I bet Snape gives us loads.” The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Neville laughed gleefully.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

NO!” He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“George and I invented them, and we’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ron!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“ ’S’ matter?” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and ... it was an  accident.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and — CRASH.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery- blond.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... C’mon now ... in the box ...” There was something familiar about that voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened!
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

...” And so they had set off.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Why aren’t you all copying that down?” There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet “You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” “No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Why?” Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —  But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It’s — ” But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Now you mention it,” said Hermione happily, “d’you know ...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the Ministry he didn’t look happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore “But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It was a page torn from a very old library book.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Everyone got quiet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

... You can try out the Wronski Feint.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, though?” “Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re okay.” “But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry, however, stood up.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“ — even more work for me!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Morfin!” said a loud voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

. . and then something else emerged from its tip .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Are you sure?” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Let’s try the next lot of hills.” So they Disapparated a few miles farther north.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

We’ve won!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I need your book,” Harry panted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I still can’t work out whether they believe he’s back or not.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Be over soon.” “No problem,” said Harry, grinning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“How touching ...” it hissed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry hadn’t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He was carrying his crossbow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry, didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?” “Hermione did it,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

On no account should any of these individuals be approached.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.

“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them more tea.
Expected: 6

His legs sprang together.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was clear that as far as they were concerned, Hermione ’s threat was way below the belt.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Merlin’s beard, no.
Expected: 6

I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me.

Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning.

Actual: 7

Was it Albus Dumbledore?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“I went and searched the Malfoys’ house.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

"... Fve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

No doubt they thought it would amuse you.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

No, I haven’t actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior’s handwriting.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Floating in midair.” There was a long silence.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts!
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.”  “But how did you — ?” An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being tortured again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Listen...” And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent- looking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Flew?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He had no choice...
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Ha!
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh?” Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house- elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s wand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I’ve got her!” He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rockfall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Let us speak openly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.” She turned to the rest of the class.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”  Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the dungeon.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Best not to roam the corridors these days.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

No one can get in.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Ahem,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“He was on the Muggle news!” Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.

“You’ve never seen Potter in your life, have you?
Expected: 7

“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an extra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.
Expected: 2

Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her.

“No second year could have done this,” said Dumbledore firmly.
Expected: 2

“He knows, man,” said Lee.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Were there escapators?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He hadn’t seen his father — he had seen himself — Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

...” “I do,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The Triwizard judge?” “Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry knew he  ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.” There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

His first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort returned to full strength.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue “as worthy of investigation.
Expected: 4

Nice and flexible.

A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“ Silenciol SILENCIO” The raven cawed more loudly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It was You-Know-Who he cared abou’!
Expected: 3

Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.

Golgomath’s lot had beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find.

“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”  Harry ignored her.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin!

Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Most mysterious.

“Giving a report.
Expected: 5

“Back, Fang.” He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“It was made for him, wasn’t it?” “No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

...” Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“So?” Harry prompted Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

” Malfoy looked up.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He laughed so hard that the dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once — “This is what Dumbledore sends his defender!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it’s a witch.” At this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?” Ron demanded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’ll have you this time, I’ll have you!”  And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Not something he intended to do, I’m sure.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

The crowd was making even more noise.
Expected: 4

“Instinctive, you know — like his mother!
Expected: 6

Xenophilius did not answer.

Actual: 3

Bring them to me here.
Expected: 6

“Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto?
Expected: 7

Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were going to say that.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“My daughter — pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?” Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.
Expected: 6

He’d have to ask someone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Neville gulped.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He couldn’t turn it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Someone would’ve seen ...” Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

. . left again .
Expected: 4

Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said “So what?” upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.

Actual: 6

Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

There was a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There was nobody left to tell.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him.

“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid.

“Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells.

“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now.
Expected: 6

“Five more minutes!” The voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Can you all hear me?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

She’s been dying to hear ...” Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Together, you and I are worth the front page.” When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

We all know you shouldn’t really have entered at all.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and Snape ’s profile, which looked angry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The goblin looked at it closely.

Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.

Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has “never felt this way about any other girl.” However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Good-bye.”  And he set off back to the castle with Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“They’re horrible things, those dementors.
Expected: 3

Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.
Expected: 6

The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony.

“I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you,” said Sirius, “see if I can scrounge another paper.” He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He didn’t want to be bothered with her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn’t let go.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He sounded exhausted.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Guess who we just met on the train?” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“ This is a gnome,” he said grimly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Can you ride?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He didn’t want to be the one who brought it all up again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

But no one’s died — because no one looked it straight in the eye.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Everyone believed her to be me.” The man’s eyelids flickered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...” The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Jc Jc Jc “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud in the Dursley household.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry moved a little closer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Hedwig was not there — not that he had expected her — but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Does that help?”  Harry thought.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

. . foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

But ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ... ,” she sobbed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“ ’Course ’e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?”  He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry’s face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry followed quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“They did,” said Fudge wearily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Well, Dumbledore believes it — ” Hermione began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Silence fell between them.
Expected: 6

Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Can’t we get anyone else?” “None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy.
Expected: 3

Ron went purple.
Expected: 4

But the bell to signal break never came.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.” “I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said Yaxley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Is this real?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Why?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I can do ten on a good weekend day.

“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.

Actual: 6

Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly.
Expected: 4

“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.
Expected: 7

They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter ... what an honor.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

In Romania.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He didn’t stop to think.
Expected: 3

“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George indignantly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

How could you make a dementor less frightening?
Expected: 3

Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
Expected: 4

“My dear boy .
Expected: 3

. . and the diadem?” “It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me.
Expected: 7

There was a large package tied to its legs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

A part of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off. . . .
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ...” “It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

But was this dying?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

That blame lies with me, and with me alone.” Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was unaware of it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.” “I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He had never been inside it before.
Expected: 7

Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!”  It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“What house?” “ This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up  attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it, mate.” Harry slept badly that night.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back ... He’ll never have another peaceful moment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I can make good use of this ... this might be exactly what I’ve been looking for.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Would you mind leaving while we change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh?”  Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid’s face that he was not referring to Harry’s physical well- being.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back,  wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“So!” he said “You’ve come back.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

There was Dumbledore’s office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star- strewn skies beyond the windows.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys’ stupid rules.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It’s against the public mood.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he was positively cute.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry knew what was on her mind at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You have it.
Expected: 4

Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light.
Expected: 4

More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies.

“Draco, pick them up!

“I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again ...”  Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.” He began to spoon soup into his mouth.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

But how do we know?” “It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“I’m going, I’m going!” And with another loud crack, he vanished.

What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”  “Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.

There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.

“But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.” “Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.
Expected: 7

“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry.

...” “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more.

“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.

How could he possibly be?

“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down.

"... there were hundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were there — ” “But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight.

He wanted to do the seeing.

A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him.

“He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named’s followers.

She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry’s mind.

Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado.

He stared into  Snape’s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but — “Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all of your schoolbooks.

“Out of St. Mungo’s, I see!” “Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new.

“You’ll be all right in a minute — almost there — ” They were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when the front door opened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who emerged.

Who was there?” But Marietta would not speak.
Expected: 5

Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
Expected: 4

“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.

The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles.

“Dumbledore “He’s tried,” said Hagrid.

“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant.

His lightheartedness was short-lived.

“I mean, at least you know now that it’s safe!” “Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry.

At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope.
Expected: 6

Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?” Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s memory, but he could not locate it.
Expected: 7

...” Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say.
Expected: 6

“I am afraid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.”  “But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his mum and dad — ” “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort... Voldemort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry.
Expected: 5

“This is mad,” said Ron.
Expected: 4

Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else.

Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.

“Dudley,” said Harry.

“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like that.

Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings.

Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat.
Expected: 1

“You think I’m right, though?” “Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily.
Expected: 6

I hope we meet again.

Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.

Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well.
Expected: 5

“Sleepin’,” breathed Hagrid.
Expected: 5

His head was spinning as though he’d just traveled miles by Floo powder.

I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.” Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Never once had he imagined Dumbledore ’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“No,” she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited — ” He flicked his wand for a fifth time.
Expected: 6

And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.

“No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off.

He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with the third task.”  THE THIRD TASK “Dumbledore reckons You- Know- Who’s getting stronger again as well?” Ron whispered.

There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air — instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead.

Professor Binns had asked for a three-foot-long composition on “The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.” “I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short.

“It’s better like that, it’ll throw them off the scent.

“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor McGonagall distractedly.

Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.

Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one.

“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.” “You have some objection?” “I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?” “I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall.

Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago.

They are deluded.

How could he be with you?” “No one was with us!” said Harry.

Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair dry.

I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.

And I have to tell  you something else too .

After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid mysteriously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.

“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice.

“This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and down in front of them.

He swore they’d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it.

By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point.

“Hermione’ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Kindly respond immediately.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

They won’t like it at all.” “Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his  basket.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes.
Expected: 1

Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

However, the truth seems altogether more shocking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I’m quite sure I slipped in a note ...” “What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry’s folder.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The girl smiled.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Come in and have some breakfast.” She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley sadly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he’d better start now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry was only half listening.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Oh, no, oh, no, oh — ” “Shut up,” said Harry frantically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

...” He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Yes, of course I have.” “Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for two exams at once?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off...” “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie.
Expected: 5

“It was appalling.

And he set off.

Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.

Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

There isn’t much time.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Go on then,” said Hagrid, beaming at her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

On Snape ’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

But Ginny ’s not ... Ginny hasn’t been ... has she?” “It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Anything I can do to help ...” “No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, “no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.” “Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Oho!” said Fudge.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

And I find that she disobeyed me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

You remember where that was?” “Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!” From what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she looked terrified.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Yer expect accidents, don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s diff’rent.
Expected: 6

“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

It’s over.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more direct action.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It’s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.” I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
Expected: 1

They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

They snapped me wand in half an’ everything.

Hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question “ — and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, reappearing suddenly at their side.

Fawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled on Dumbledore ’s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight embrace.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ...” “I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side of the table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile.
Expected: 2

“If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.

“All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.

He got to his feet, trembling.

“If you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s  putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.” Harry had no retort.

“Oh, let’s get out of here.” She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked.

The Slytherins looked excited.

“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.

“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ” he said, opening the door a bit wider.

“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”  “Have you, have you ...” said Scrimgeour.
Expected: 6

“I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

And then Harry heard a scream and a crash.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Harry, do you know any of these men?” “No,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 3

“Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.
Expected: 6

Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.

“Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance — ” “Kill the snake?” “Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.

“Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.” “Did you see anyone near here that night?” said Harry.

“That’s for you.

“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry’s nose, uncharacteristically brisk.

The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.

There was a moment’s silence.

Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump.

“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street — ” “I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later.

“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile.

You lost control.” “Did you see everything I saw?” Harry asked, unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer.
Expected: 5

He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.” Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke.

Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.

Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free.

Expected: 4

In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you.

“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order.

“Problem?

I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.

“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

This is most unusual.
Expected: 6

Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And if the culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys.
Expected: 2

He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff.

Actual: 5

“How really corking to see you — ” “I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair.
Expected: 3

Some of the elf-made wine will do.”  Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door.

“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry’s flobberworm was still alive.

Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.

“How’d the exam go, Snivelly?” said James.

Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice.
Expected: 6

“Follow me,” said Snape.
Expected: 2

“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — ” said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.
Expected: 2

Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
Expected: 6

Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.
Expected: 4

...” “Yeah, all right,” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Won’t you sit down?” “Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless.
Expected: 5

“All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus.

“Could on’y travel by nigh an’ through wild country an’ stuff.

“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?” he hissed, his face now a rich plum color.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!” “I can’t,” said Harry.

Two young children came running into the hall.

The small patch of Hagrid’s face that was not black or purple flushed.
Expected: 5

“How are you?

“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler.

“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” “Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.

The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward.

But he is determined that Draco should try first.

“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.

He looked thoroughly put out about something.

“He’s getting away!

No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before.
Expected: 5

“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

The match became still faster, but more brutal.

Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.

“Thestrals aren’ dangerous!

“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!” “Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

What about you, Weasley?” Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.

“He came back to the country just because my scar twinged.

Something he didn’t have last time.” I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel.

“The enemy\ Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat down.
Expected: 3

Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He cleared his throat nervously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I want you to follow him around the clock.” “Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Felix Felicis!” “No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.

The snake hissed.

“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face.

Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We’re nearly there.
Expected: 6

Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all.
Expected: 7

Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Tuney!” But Petunia was running away.
Expected: 7

Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
Expected: 3

“Be brave like my mother, Professor.

“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.

“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

Oh — talk of the devil!

The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly  cold.
Expected: 5

What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?
Expected: 1

“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.

Bode was under the Imperius Curse...

I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.

The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain  over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink.
Expected: 2

Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light.
Expected: 4

It was a sickening sight.
Expected: 1

“Nose out, Ron, or I’ll burn that for you too,” said Fred, waving his wand threateningly.

“I was sleeping.

“Want a game of chess, Harry?” “Yeah, okay,” said Harry.

She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection.

My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle.

Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.” “He used to be a Death Eater,” said Ron stubbornly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I was hoping it’d be this weekend — ” But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,” drawled Mr. Malfoy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Does anyone else know where it fell?” “No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Of course, it’s not what you know,” he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, “it’s who you know.
Expected: 5

All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily.
Expected: 4

“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in London?” “Diagon Alley,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?” “Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

If he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.” “Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Now listen to me!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Scabbers, what are you doing here?”  He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?” “I didn’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day!

She went on, more calmly, “Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic.

He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower.

“She’s still letting him wander about wherever he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now.

“I have never been much of a potion- brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it.
Expected: 3

At least you’re not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.
Expected: 2

Malfoy smiled nastily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.” Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement.

“She’s just outside the door.

Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy’s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

You said it was a joke!” shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“ ’Night — ” “Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” “No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night, everyone.” Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“ ‘Hello, Hagrid.
Expected: 2

“Well jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the lids on, and we’ll see what happens.” But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in.

Levski!
Expected: 4

“I won’ti I won’t be in Slytherin!” “James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Then he said,  Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Well — there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Percy’s letter was short and irritated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?” “Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Surely you’re going to say good-bye?” Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously.
Expected: 4

“There you go, Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George.
Expected: 5

Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.

By eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library.

“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George.

“Good lord, is it Harry Potter?
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

She doesn’t care!” “It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Kreacher?” There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her!

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles.

Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Her face was covered in black fur.

They were waiting: Everything was waiting.

Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.

Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes  were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.

Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “ Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal.

Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.

It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified.

It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too.

Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!” “There!” Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor.

“I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”  Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.

“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini.” Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded.

“I don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused...” “Very well, very well — Potter,” said Snape, “we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead.” He turned and swept from his office.

Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:  Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.

He raised the sword in both his hands — The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth — But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow.

“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “ — not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole.

“Wait till we’re inside!” He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire to it with his wand tip.

Harry and Ron leaned in closer.

“No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft.

Dudley didn’t even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery).
Expected: 4

“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t  met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
Expected: 1

The week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack, and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron and Hermione again because he did not want another telling-off from Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“ Come out, come out, little HarryV’ she called in her mock-baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors.
Expected: 5

Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.

When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet once more.

“These are nice, did you put them up?” “No,” said Harry, “it was Dobby the house-elf.” “Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry’s head.

“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague’s house?”  “Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,” said Dumbledore.

This was the worst he had ever felt.

First Harry, then Hagrid “You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said Ron nervously.
Expected: 4

His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been  uncomfortable.
Expected: 6

“Must ... tell ... Dumbledore ...” “Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly.

Ron came to his aid.

It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery.

“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.” He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.

“There’s nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore?” “Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head.

Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, “Remember all that water on the floor?

Harry sped up.

HARRY!” Someone had hit him around the face.
Expected: 5

“Well see each other again,” he said.
Expected: 3

He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was still putting up a terrific fight.
Expected: 2

There can’t be any other reason.” Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore’s office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“In a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared.” Harry said nothing.
Expected: 5

He had done it.
Expected: 1

... What kind of mission would You-Know- Who have given him?” “How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at Hogwarts?

“Let’s try again...” He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions.

He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.

I’m not going there without him.” “Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know- Who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” sniggered Ron.

“Mummy told you not to!” Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.

“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon,” said Ron.

It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.

He stopped in his tracks.

Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom.

He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground.

“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron.

Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you.
Expected: 7

... I’m afraid it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ... and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — “Ah, well, Snape ... Harry Potter, you know ... we’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.” “And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Expected: 3

I wish he was mine, he’s really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord.” Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot.

The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded- up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings.

“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 4

“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?” said Hermione.

“Hocus pocus — squiggly wiggly — ” “MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house.
Expected: 2

“What are you doing down here at this time of night?”  “I just wondered where you — ” Ron broke off, shrugging.
Expected: 4

“They’ll repel water!” Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
Expected: 3

Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings.
Expected: 7

He should have been blasted into smithereens.

Carry on.” Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.)
Expected: 6

Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley.
Expected: 4

I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing!
Expected: 6

Off you go!” There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but  nobody spoke.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.
Expected: 6

Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before.

“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody from behind him.

“Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted — ”  “The Sorting Ceremony is over,” said Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him: To the Dark Lord I know I will be dead long before you read this  but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.

We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway!

Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.

“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.

People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they’re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time.

At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit.

“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.

He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?

Him?

Harry told him.
Expected: 6

It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed.

And where was Ginny?

Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

“Right, follow me, but careful, now.” They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Expected: 1

Why didn’t he just let him die?” “I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — ” “What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Why not try an open request for once?” Voldemort sneered.

Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.” “You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply.

The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.

Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth around it, and the golden- jacketed band trooped toward a podium.

He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.

Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him.

“We’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.

“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry’s neck.

“Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though no time has passed, as  though they were merely knocked to the ground, they will not remember — ” “Where will you go, Dumbledore?” whispered Professor McGonagall.

But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it  perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.” “But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily.

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen.

The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak.

Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving  ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed.

It was fixed upon Harry.

He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.

Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.

The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light.

“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.

“What’s Hogsmeade like?

One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry’s face.

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page.
Expected: 7

He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn’t seem a good moment to try — what if the whole tunnel caved in?

They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake.

They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house.

Filch kept it fresh in everyone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back.

“I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again.

“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” said Ron, starting to get angry.

“I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection.

Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed.

“Slick,” snorted Ron.

So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.” “OUCH!” Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there.

Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.” “Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said Dumbledore.

He turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon.

“Madam Pomfrey?” “No,” said Dumbledore swiftly.

Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.

The contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown everywhere.
Expected: 2

You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right to eavesdrop on him it’s you...” Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.
Expected: 5

“No, I don’t,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters’ death.

The Dursleys got into bed.

I thought I knew him!” But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past.
Expected: 7

“Shall we go?” Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited.
Expected: 1

“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, Hermione.” She looked scandalized.
Expected: 6

“See you then,” said Dudley.

Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.

“Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die...

“Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination?

“Who ... you?” he whispered.

Seamus is worse.

He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Yes, he’s certainly seen something Potter hasn’t!” Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them collide?
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Professor Snape would like a word with you.” Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron’s, and he was egging it on enthusiastically.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him.
Expected: 6

Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane.

The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it.

“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.

Neville chuckled.

He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain.

Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Hermione, what — ?” “In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough.

Sorry ... did I say worst?

“That’s not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your mother — here — ” He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud, “ Dad is still alive.

Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.

Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house, tail between his legs.
Expected: 2

He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.

Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling.

During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What’s happening?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

It was better like this.
Expected: 7

“Some o’ the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.” “And how many were there?” asked Harry.

“Young Sirius Black lent it to me.

“My dad used this spell,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle.
Expected: 4

He felt very groggy.
Expected: 3

Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone ... feeble and powerless.

“Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need here.

Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

There was no answer.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Who did that?” “Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the air of one commenting on the weather.

“That was some catch you made.

“Not that bad.

Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them.

Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him.
Expected: 7

The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“What’s a Howler?” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

When he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry — ” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter?
Expected: 7

It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.

“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry, talking fast.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Not that she doesn’t like you, of course,” she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black-and-gold quill.
Expected: 5

He knew immediately where he was.

“I’ll — I’ll be in my office, getting — getting ready.” And he left the room.

Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he’s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky’s involved in all sorts of societies, she admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she’d put Charms first.

“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely.

You haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!” Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.

Harry hadn’t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late.

Fear flooded him.

He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she wasn’t even human!” “Well, she’s not,” said Ron.
Expected: 4

“Just — just to be clear,” he said.
Expected: 7

It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal — a real rival — “You haff never ... you haff not ...” “No,” said Harry very firmly.

“One of the dementors of Azkaban.” Everyone stared at him.

He knew what the dementor must have done.

“Have a present.” He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.

Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH!” Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.

“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?” “What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
Expected: 5

Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that  he had mislabelled Venus as Mars.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Can yeh believe that, Harry?” The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.
Expected: 6

Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.

He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.

“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”  Ron followed right away.

“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her.

Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet.
Expected: 5

“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” Harry could have kicked him.
Expected: 5

Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.

“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look.

“And not one step down Knockturn Alley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs.

It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads.

He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing.

But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.” “Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.
Expected: 5

“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently.

“Definitely,” said Harry.

However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them.

Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the  ground.
Expected: 2

He didn’t think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway.
Expected: 2

... “Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do the task.

If so, she was wrong on both counts.

“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.

... Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s taking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!” And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg.

Harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline: HARRY POTTER “DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS” The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent.

He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.

Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.

She shrieked and jumped backward.

You enjoyed it?”  “Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly.

“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.

Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms.

Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor.

“Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?” “For him?” shouted Snape.

The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.

“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table.

“Well, I suppose it could have been worse,” she said.

“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him.

“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron.

But I don’t reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he?

“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered.

Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron’s eye and they both grinned; Snape ’s mouth thinned and  he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once.

“He thought I’d like this.” Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything.

“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its  name faced upward.
Expected: 3

He was dead.

The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione, and Hagrid could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing.

I stole it.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face.

It remained as firmly shut as ever.

“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around.

“Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ” Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius?

This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip.

“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice.

It was time to do what he had to do ... to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.

I don’t know if this is a good idea.

She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.

He was far from blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it.

Narcissa threw back her hood.

Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d suggested him as Seeker in the first place.

“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.

Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” “Hey!” James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.

Professor McGonagall’s eyes flew open.

“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school?” “Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto his face.

“They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,” said Colin Creevey.

Feeling dazed, Harry left.

“OK.” The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June.

“Nothing!

“It’s ... it’s ...” he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, “I know.” Lupin hesitated.

“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified.
Expected: 3

An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

I don’t believe it!
Expected: 5

Except that the words weren’t what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin.

“That’s a girls’ bathroom!” he gasped.

Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder.

“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion — both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire — I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus!

Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own body — all else was swirling darkness.

“You wait,” she said resentfully.

Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.

Wouldn’t be doing my duty — ” “Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling.

Harry saw Ron checking how it looked in the black window.

“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.
Expected: 2

A powerful one.” “But who conjured it?”  Harry didn’t say anything.
Expected: 3

What’s happening?” “No idea — sit down — ” There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.

THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find.

“Mr.

“What the — ?” Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard.

“I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t me, it was — ” But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window.
Expected: 5

Now listen closely, Severus.
Expected: 7

See you later, Arthur.” He Disapparated.
Expected: 4

Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.
Expected: 3

He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.

“You, boy — give me Peter, please.
Expected: 3

“Where — ?” “Oh, there’s a really nice place just up here, haven’t you ever been to Madam Puddifoot’s?” she said brightly, and she led him up a side road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
Expected: 1

“You mean it?” “Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“She doesn’t really want to be here but I made her come with me.

Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in — ” When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, “You have thirty minutes — start — now\” Harry looked down at his paper and read: 1.
Expected: 2

Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously.
Expected: 4

He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...” Quirrell’s voice trailed away.
Expected: 1

Ron nearly dropped the jar.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Macnair, you’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure — ” Macnair’s face vanished from the window.

“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” Ron asked Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

His immediate thought was that someone, surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Hang on ...” Harry muttered to Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

I’m doing it because — I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted them to become killers — just for you.” No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He let out a yell of fury and fear.
Expected: 7

You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son.

“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said Monsieur Delacour.

I’m not surprised.

“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.

“I mean, they’ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too.

“Not every day,” said Albus quickly.
Expected: 7

“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,” said Harry.
Expected: 3

A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

Now he’d done it.

... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned.

But the dot wasn’t labeled “Severus Snape” ... it was Bartemius Crouch.

“Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon.
Expected: 2

“Master has gone out, Harry Potter.” “Where’s he gone?
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Here at Hogwarts ?” “Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Rheumatism too.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought.
Expected: 5

Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet.

The next-door neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.
Expected: 7

“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape — ” “Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I knew it,” he murmured.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

They left the Owlery together.
Expected: 5

Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

MYRTLE!” “Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be really upset,” Hermione whispered frantically.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I had to track these people down.
Expected: 2

A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward?
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should it?” he finished, watching her anxiously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet.

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.

Then he appeared to come to life again.

Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”  “Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day.
Expected: 5

He now felt extremely sick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.

“R — r — riddikulusV’ squeaked Neville.

“Is that your sister?

“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.

He looked around the room.

“Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle — ” “I had to,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!”  “Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione.

Zey are both ill, tired — ”  “I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait.

I mean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

So what will stop you dying now when I strike?” “Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.

“They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions.

“Come to throw something else at me?” Harry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would I throw something at you?” “Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father.

“Unbelievablel” beamed Seamus.

Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Consider, Minister — against all school rules — after all the precautions put in place for his protection — out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too — ” “Well, well ... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?” he sneered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said Peeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I wish you’d let me give it a trim.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did.

Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the window into the night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“He’s replaced his father as a Death Eater!”  There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter.

Actual: 7

Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost.
Expected: 3

The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor.
Expected: 2

“Come on, I’ll show you my bedroom.” They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house.

“If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?” The champions nodded.
Expected: 4

Harry told them what he’d heard.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid ’s first lesson to be a success.
Expected: 3

“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.

Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore.

“That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there.

“We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.

Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry was letting the words wash over him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.

I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.

“It’s ... Aragog.
Expected: 6

Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly underrepresented.” “And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
Expected: 3

It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Oh, I’ll get her back for this.

His nose was also slowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.
Expected: 2

“Severus ...” The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening.
Expected: 6

As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape — ” “Let me — ”  “ — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Hagrid, do you think — ?” “Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid.

Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from within the cabin.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“How dare you!” “It’s McGonagall!” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did.
Expected: 7

“Right,” said Ron, looking around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person .

The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry’s wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.

He wanted Sirius to stay.

“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on Harry.
Expected: 3

“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

You’re joking.” “I think ... Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled voice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and he spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . . . “When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments .

She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry’s eyes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“You know her — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.” “Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

There was a commotion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Someone who won’t want the Chamber of Secrets closed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding?
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“I just meant — Hagrid, how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?” Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid ’s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.
Expected: 4

“I’m getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They were gone.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I set my sights lower ...

A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.

“Sir — Professor Dumbledore?
Expected: 1

The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted, “Expelliarmus\” Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall,  propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak.

Actual: 5

Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.
Expected: 7

“Even though she was not your ’ostage.” “Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue.

He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest.

One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick.

“Come and get it!” she giggled maliciously.

Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken.

“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Malfoy.

“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them.

“I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor, I’m ...” But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.

Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?” Harry considered this possibility.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“No, it’s not,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I’m missing Agrippa.” “What?” “Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys’ dormitory Harry looked back.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What’s got into — ?” And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Get in here!
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I’d pay five Galleons for that!” Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I thought not,” said Snape contemptuously.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Cough up, everyone, I haven’t got enough gold for all of these...” Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The headmaster is busy, Potter ... what’s this rubbish, Potter?’ Why couldn’t he have just got out of the way?” “Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron quickly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Reckon I’m lonely or summat?” “No,” said Harry at once.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Can’t anyone help you?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The effect was instantaneous.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Well ... I’d better go and notify the Ministry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Five o’clock.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“He told me after Potions!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... Malfoy would get back first .
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Look, here come more now... You two must really smell...” Harry turned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“It isn’t a question ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Plenty of time for all that when you’re older.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they  mounted the verges.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third- year girl eagerly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Onlookers all over the room were laughing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“It was Hagrid, Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He couldn’t think anymore.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Blimey,” said the other twin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“You’ve met Malfoy before?” Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The Blast- Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.” Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He never had much sense.” “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frowning at Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.” Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Nick!” he roared.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Of course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ” “Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Your world.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The woman beckoned again, more vigorously.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Hagrid!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“You’ll have to tell me when you’ve found out.” “What d’you mean?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WONT EVEN LISTEN — ” “SILENCE!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The teachers have got to know!” “He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry kept looking around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

. . his wide red eyes were still shocked .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Rita.’ I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?” “No, she probably wasn’t.” Harry looked down upon Dumbledore ’s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He has braved so many dangers already!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“He’s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped-up Granger Mudblood.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Next term we shall progress to palmistry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I don’ fly, meself.
Expected: 5

“You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?” “Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“So you never — never attacked anyone?” “Never,” croaked the old spider.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

AND IVE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWOVE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE?
Expected: 5

For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Dear Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Aragog died last night Harry and Ron, you met him, and you know how special he was.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.” “Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“It’s obvious, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“You bowed to me once in a shop.” “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, “Harry Potter, a word, please.” Harry turned.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“ Name ... Harry Potter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’  Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly blurred.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A terrified excitement shot through him — any moment now — “Come on!” he muttered, staring about.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Wha — ?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“How come?” “It was Hagrid,” said Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

If it did ... if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What are you doing?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Where was it now?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Or were they all invisible, too?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Aragog seemed to be tired of talking.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Harry turned to Hedwig.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful  properties.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.” It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

...” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Malfoy gave a harsh laugh.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“You’re lucky you weren’t killed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

... I’m waiting for a telephone call, you see .
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

They have probably already profited from the traitor F irenze ’s teachings ...” “Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime... We do not touch the innocent.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Come on, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He sounded avid.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their books?” said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared in opposite directions.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“If only we’d done human Transfiguration already!
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“We just — met here.” “Indeed?” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Get back!” shouted Hagrid.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

... One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“As you’re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

All I’ve got is Scabbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

At last, he said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur,  black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

This Mark has  been growing clearer all year.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He heard a sharp intake of breath.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

An extremely tense silence followed these words.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Ah, I see his  house-elf’s saving him a seat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Then he blinked  and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

...” And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“ ‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’ ” Harry read.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“But that’s no reason to lose our heads.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?” asked Ron hopefully.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“On three!
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He seemed to be unconscious.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Ernie didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

He couldn’t afford to let it happen again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Oh no\” squealed Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

And — forgive me — you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you not?” “They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

. . one of them would come and perform the magic I  could not, to restore me to a body .
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The crowd laughed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

...” Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

...” “So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape ’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Sorry?” “We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.” “Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Why’s that first year taking pictures?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Look,” he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, “let’s not talk about Cedric right now... Let’s talk about something else...” But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Bless you,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I’ll have you.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Ron muttered, “Show-offs.” “Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby.
Expected: 6

Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm — ” “Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape without looking up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Harry shrugged.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“In here, Harry ... in here, and sit down.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

This morning, it was motorcycles.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

What about that escaped prisoner, eh?” As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

At once, Kreacher hurried forward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Ready?” she said breathlessly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I’ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Prove it,” he hissed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“That is the question, isn’t it?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

His heart was still hammering very fast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s polite, see?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...” He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail’s arm.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

This, therefore, they will do.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He gave the wall a little push.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any moment.” “So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They died begging me for mercy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He would do better to abandon it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak — ” “You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.” “And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Or maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of  armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls — ” “You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Help!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I’d blow meself up before I set foot in that place.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

...” Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Stood out a mile.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

. . how would that have looked, if she’d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control — ” “She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!” Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“He loves playing with them.” “Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.” “Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“If anyone deserves that place, he does.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I ... okay, thanks,” he muttered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Why doesn’t everyone come back?
Expected: 5

A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding ...

I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels ??

“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled.

“We’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know!” And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.

This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherin’s mark.

This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well.

“How much — OUCH!” Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.

They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room.

The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.

Harry and Ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.

About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.
Expected: 4

As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in.

And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch ’s face was stricken with terror.

Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry.

Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.

“Reparo\” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave of her wand.

“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George.

“But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right than most to — ” “He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley.

“To drink, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely.

“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,” said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination.

It was the only chance, the only slender hope  left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go.

Hell give you all the details, hell tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, hell tell you what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself.

“We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.

“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” He ignored Hermione ’s hand.

“Really get to work on that egg.”  “Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” Harry lied.

Then, at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking their O.W.L.s.

Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.

Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious.

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them.

Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him.

Harry ducked.

Professor McGonagall’s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult.

Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.

Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.” Harry snorted into his plate of goulash.

Madam Hooch was zooming toward one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was at this angle.

“In the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wizards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures.

He had been hugged by a complete stranger.

The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again.

“He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ” “Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.

“Percy sent back his Christmas jumper.” “Without a note,” added George.

“What do I care how he looks?
Expected: 6

“Accio Wand\” cried Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

You can have it, I don’t really want it.” Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Surely Black, as Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

... Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.
Expected: 4

“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Out!
Expected: 2

Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead... “Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to him!” Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry heard a sob to his left and looked around.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.” Ron glanced at his watch.

“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry.

“No — listen!” he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione’s face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.” He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.

“Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes “We do like them!” lied Hermione at once.

It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in.

Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.
Expected: 4

They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you — ” “I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

But my plan failed.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!” “No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.” “I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!” “You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.” For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It’s really important.
Expected: 7

He’s ill or something — he’s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore!

I returned two hours later.
Expected: 6

Wasn’t anybody going to say “well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly?
Expected: 5

“Weird).” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Amazing!”  “So ...” Harry was struggling to keep up.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs — please feel free — ” “Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Protect her pretty neck?” “If I were on duty ...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

But why are you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry’s death?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He could have invited friends to his house.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Stay away from this place tonight.” “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There was nothing in there.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off?
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.” Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“We won!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It’s my house, you see.” An ugly flush suffused Snape ’s pallid face.
Expected: 5

“Harry?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was now two o’clock.
Expected: 3

Who shall drag the body?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He looks fine.” Ron nodded his appreciation of this news.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I thought the map must be malfunctioning.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d done the right thing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said Harry, his throat dry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

... Then, without warning, his head hit something hard.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Stars were blossoming in the blackness.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

What is this?” “Seal the exit!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“The Memory Charm backfired.

“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Get ’em all up, Ron.” “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Very brave ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

And Dudley?” “I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

He couldn’t see whether Justin was among them.
Expected: 2

“I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,” she said loftily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t remember anything she’d said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What d’you mean?” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I forgot to go to Charms!” “But how could you forget?” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help  thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry, dear?” She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Sit,” said Snape.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You can kip under that,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said Ron, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.” “I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,” Dumbledore added.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

... She put too much into the diary, into me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.” “There’s something else,” said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He turned to look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Snape’s,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

...”  Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder.
Expected: 4

The staff was seated at last.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

. . he had no more expected this than Harry had .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ” Harry gave a hollow laugh.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There was a sudden movement behind them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll see.” And she swung forward.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground;  Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There you are, thank goodness!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Useful, though ...” Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius’s chicken bones.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I think James was everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Those treacherous cowards who wouldn’t even brave Azkaban for him.
Expected: 4

“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Er — I’m just going over here with ...” He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable — ” “No!” said Ron gleefully.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

One of them was Levicorpus — ” “Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Oh, Harry — this is absolutely wonderful — ” For he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.

Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him.

“Those in favor of going to see Lovegood — ” His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle.
Expected: 1

“You drink that,” said Harry.

“Our Stunners went right through those trees.

The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed.

Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s answer.

“I think it’s a warning ... it means danger’s coming.

Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh.

He would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay there all night if he had to.

“I wonder what he’s up to?

Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.

“Thatll take all weekend, that will.

“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm.

“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” “Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views.

It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.

He won’t be there for another couple of hours.

One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it — “TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers.

“Er — yeah, why not?” Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week.

He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.

“Why?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.

The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel ... pointless.

“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece.
Expected: 3

To Harry’s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn’t object.

Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.

“You’re not worried, are you?” “No,” said Harry.

“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly.

When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.

Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.

He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him.

Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again.

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy tears.
Expected: 2

He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance.
Expected: 7

Seeing the shocked look on Harry’s face, Ron added, “It doesn’t  hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.” He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.

If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a “half-blood Prince’!” “Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione ...” “But it would!

As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.

“Thank goodness, what an ’orrible — ” “Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet.

It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear.

She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

I heard what happened the other night.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“We ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Yes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.” “How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.” “ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his chair.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,” said Hermione indifferently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Look at the signature, Harry!” He obeyed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Pygmy Puffs,” said George.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

You can start collecting.” Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.” “He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human — ” “ What did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognized as Bane.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go picking them up and playing with them .

“Doesn’t matter.

They were cornered.

“Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know.

He read the words on the tombstone again.

Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Hey, Harry!” Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Look at the balance on it!
Expected: 3

“Count yer coins!
Expected: 4

Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Expected: 2

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“You’re letting people know he’s back?” They all smiled humorlessly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I has seven now, sir.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Nothing there!” he shouted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you’re getting all the credit for his dirty work.” “Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

White fog was blinding him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Oh this is stupid — lumos\” She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

But Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.” “Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Hermione going to look in before the match?” he added casually.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and — er — ” He noticed a raised hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“What do you mean?” he asked.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort’s up to — ” Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“We’re still going to — ”  “You realize she’s including Quidditch in this?” Angelina said over him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Mrs. Weasley was close by him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your touch.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic?
Expected: 5

“C-cars, Molly, dear?” “Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He couldn’t miss it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Hermione recoiled, looking horrified.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Oy, you there!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The golden grilles clanged shut behind him.
Expected: 7

“Gryffindor,” said Ron.

She had been crying.

The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin- driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank’s underground tunnels.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They were not enslaved, as I was.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Bellatrix,” said Tonks.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It is ... very secret.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

I taught him!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“That’s not all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

All three glasses vanished.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He had never known ... never, in four years, bothered to find out ... “The Longbottoms were very popular,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,” Dumbledore went on, smiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“They’d have to be really thick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“There’s one of them now!” The figure was emerging from a side room.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Its voice was distant and echoing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We’d never be allowed ... ’specially you, Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

. . this miracle .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

But the man was stirring ... a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He raised his wand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

... “So you see, I had to do something.

The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant.

Expected: 4

“What?” said Ron shortly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Go!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Maybe.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

— ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ ” “I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.” “That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Mr.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

We’re on the team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Hermione was dancing on tiptoes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.”  “But she did have his baby.” “But not until a year after they were married.
Expected: 6

At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.

...”  “Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly.
Expected: 6

Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term.
Expected: 3

Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.” He looked up at Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Mr. Weasley did not let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby.

Actual: 7

...” Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn’t.
Expected: 6

Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services.

“In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars.
Expected: 5

“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

We’ve got to get into the castle.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today — ” “Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we don’t.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

And then he saw something to make his heart stand still.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He couldn’t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort’s voice had sounded so close.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

...” “Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Instead he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“We’ve got to move!” “We mustn’t, I keep telling you — ” “Not to interfere!
Expected: 3

Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And Master Regulus said ... he said ...” The old elf rocked faster than ever.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He looked nervous.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Marietta’s mother, Minister,” she added, looking up at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation.

We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Harry turned it off quickly and dressed  silently.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ...” “Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Where have you brought me?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But then, Father’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too junior to know about it, Weasley ... yes ... they probably don’t talk about important stuff in front of him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“You sleep with this under your pillow?” But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in... Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right?
Expected: 5

“And you’ve got her eyes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.

“Acciol” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes.
Expected: 4

“The dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said excitedly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Because if it does ...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore’s death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

But nothing doing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“We’ve forgotten the way to our common room.” “I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes.
Expected: 2

“He’ll be in worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him.

But remember what the Healer told us?

“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at Hagrid’s window, staring out at Buckbeak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“This will do, Harry.” He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

. .
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“All right, Harry?
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...” They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“ Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now — ” “Watch who you’re calling gruesome!” said Ron, his ears turning red.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!” “But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.” “Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Fred was right.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

... That must never happen again.” “You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question.
Expected: 7

One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding.
Expected: 3

“I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term.

Was Cedric pulling his leg?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Ah yes, so it is.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.” It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

. . “Made a potion ... got his body back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He dashed to the mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“I can’t believe him,” said Harry tensely, “if he’s caught ...”  “Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch’s skinny ankles.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” “No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.” He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away.
Expected: 2

It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Keep him?” he said uncertainly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

According to the book, he had to stir  counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water.
Expected: 6

“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“She shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.” “Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.
Expected: 5

A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“It’s there, it’s up there\” Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk.

All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.
Expected: 1

Ah, and this must be Petunia.” The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Oh yeah, Professor Snape.” “Snape?”  “Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh?
Expected: 1

Harry stared at the dot.
Expected: 4

“What ’re you doing that for?” “Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

For a few seconds, there was complete silence.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other.

Ron led the way over to them.

“Don’t you understand?
Expected: 1

He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing .
Expected: 7

Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes.

After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.
Expected: 4

Close up, Harry thought he looked ill.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus\ Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him.

But I know better.

In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one.

Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.

They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets.

Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin.

“Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was with them too.”  And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.

As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.

Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all.

Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads.

Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?

They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

What do you want?” he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry,  upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O.

“We’re friends of Hagrid ’s,” Harry shouted.

“Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry — ” Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.

“You had too much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare — ” “I’m telling you — ” “Now, really, enough’s enough!” Professor McGonagall was back.

I was nine.” “I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.

I wasn’t attacking her, I was only — ” “Who cares if she supports the Tornados?” “Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season — ” “But what does it matter?” “It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the bandwagon — ” “That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it.

The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”  “The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore.

Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside.
Expected: 3

All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.
Expected: 1

The boy has undoubtedly been foolish.

We haven’t visited him for ages!” “No!” said Hermione quickly.

Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said “Sonorusl” and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Like Filch ’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name.
Expected: 7

Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons?
Expected: 4

“What’s up with you, Harry?” “Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.
Expected: 3

As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.
Expected: 6

“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him.
Expected: 3

They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?” “Right,” said Harry weakly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him as rather ominous.

“Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month.

“Of course I want to leave the Dursleys!

“If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!” “What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted.
Expected: 3

Go on...”  They trooped back into the corridor.

...
Expected: 6

He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance.
Expected: 4

Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking.
Expected: 5

Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut.
Expected: 3

It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.

He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.
Expected: 2

“These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle.

‘Mr.

I want to know — aha.” He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.

Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand — but it wasn’t there.
Expected: 4

“Dear, dear ... his own son ...” Harry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches.

Are you a common mule?” “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze.

Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself facedown upon the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Here, Harry — couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Back, you rogue!” The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn’t get it out again.
Expected: 3

Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.

She tried to shield them with her arms.

“But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again.

He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.

Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him.

“The hat feels itself honor- bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels — ” But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches.

Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.

If I could just find out what it is ... ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her ...” “Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked her.

“C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily.

And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.” They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents.
Expected: 4

Harry, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices — — Time to fly ... “...to the Ministry?”  “To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback.

The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.

“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you’re bleeding.” “Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve.

“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?” Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked in front of Harry’s throat.

She ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie.

“Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he?

“I’ve ... I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked.

He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
Expected: 5

Let’s go.” They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms.
Expected: 5

“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.
Expected: 4

“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” “Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.

“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry’s face.
Expected: 7

“I’ll show you now,” said Wood.

“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Harry leaned forward.

“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied.

I suggest you make a start on these sweets.

Did you steal it back?” There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face.
Expected: 7

“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away, please!” But Harry did not lower his wand.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Expected: 4
Actual: 2

However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!” “Really?” said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked around at Harry.
Expected: 5

They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were sure it was deserted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

They  heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall — Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family.
Expected: 3

“The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.” Hermione snorted.
Expected: 3

It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.

Harry pointed.

“Maybe .

Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?

Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.

“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” said Hermione thoughtfully.

“The stairs are completely blocked.

Shame — he was a talented boy.

“No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?” Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag, and set to work.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, “I shall take you to your vault.” He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling.
Expected: 7

Harry glanced around at their fellow guests.
Expected: 6

Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance — Gringotts Bank.

Actual: 7

We begin!” It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” He turned back to Harry.

“Mommy will never forget you!” How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra- large toy out of his sack.
Expected: 4

I want to see you both!” Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised.
Expected: 3

“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.

Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.

“Lovely day.”  He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron.
Expected: 1

Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” “ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.” He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Have you no shame?
Expected: 1

Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and vanished behind them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid’s house.
Expected: 3

And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives.

He had to start somewhere.

“Ron — Harry” — his voice sounded shaky — “Hermione — are you all right?” “Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change?
Expected: 6

I’ll tell everyone Hermione ’s my cousin — ” Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T.
Expected: 6

He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see.” There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field.

“I don’t want to.
Expected: 6

“But she’s still sticking up for it!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!” “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Fred and George were both helping customers.
Expected: 6

“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled.
Expected: 5

“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter.

“An’ you too, Neville, eh?

I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard — ” “A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?” Ron repeated faintly.
Expected: 2

“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
Expected: 1

Harry was able to answer that at once.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Thought we’d have some fun with ’em today.

Actual: 7

“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What’s Percy writing to me for?” He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?” Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I do not think that it is of great importance.” “Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

We won!” Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

But then disagreements sprang up between them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me ... except for Hogwarts.” When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Can we go in here?” Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.
Expected: 5

Harry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade.
Expected: 7

He smoothed it out.

“Excuse me, I must go and assist him.” With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.

“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.
Expected: 2

“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.
Expected: 1

Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous.

“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf.

And Ludo Bagman’s not helping.

Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs.

It was no good.

Little boy ?

I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.” Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my grandmother wants.” “Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He knew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose, but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.
Expected: 4

He’s not coming.” “And he was sure he’d come!

“Some sort of test, I think.

... Then, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Harry, Ron, and Hermione glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“The news would have leaked out anyway.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

They changed and then gulped down the juice.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It was hairless and scaly - looking, a dark, raw, reddish black.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

There was silence.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

. . but I waited in vain.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, “you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He lies ...” “Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.” “And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third- eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” “What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

You’re still very pale...” “I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, “I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.” “Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He looked around at Professor McGonagall.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?”  “No,” said Ron, without hesitation.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier.

The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Boot, Terry!” “RAVENCLAW!” The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Harry changed direction mid- word.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“We told you to get rid of the lot!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He comes from a family of good Quidditch players.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“We’ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be off.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“Listening to Snape’s reports, having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time .
Expected: 5

Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

It was nearly fifty years old.

...
Expected: 4

At last, she clapped her hands.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The vast majority of his possessions — his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects — were left to Hogwarts.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Did you hear about Gringotts?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

...”  “Are you mad?” said Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.
Expected: 2

Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met!
Expected: 5

Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far.
Expected: 1

Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.” “So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Do you understand now, deluded ones?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Something was slithering up from its depths.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, “Diagon Alley!” and vanished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Nothing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They were both staring at him, lost for words.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.
Expected: 3

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he passed the householders.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Beaten him once before, haven’t you?”  “Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!” Mrs. Weasley said angrily.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

They had reached the edge of the forest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Getting to their feet very  cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Snape had to be here somewhere...
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ...” The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The prospect of parting — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this.” “Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of great surprise.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“All right, I’ll try you.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Forget my brother and his clever schemes.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Hagrid, talk to me — ” But the dark mass did not stir.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

... She was going to be murdered.
Expected: 3

You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.” “I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Cho blushed and kept walking.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Harry, come here,” she said urgently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“But seriously” — his manner changed; it became  suddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving!
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.” Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

It’s him!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

They could hear the werewolf howling behind them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer’s night, mark you.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Then the whole crowd gasped.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to finally see our name on the thing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

His mother’s face, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!” Dobby squeaked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

I think Dobby will look after her for us.” “Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his mirror in a wheezy voice.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” “No — listen, I didn’t mean — ” “ — to call me Mudblood?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“I ... dunno what happened,” said Harry truthfully, standing up.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

... “Then .
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He looked around at Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Pull them out, Potter!” Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“How can he be sure what he saw?” “Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“She’s gone a bit funny.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said George.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them — “WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late — CRUNCH.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The road to the  village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

When he looked up, the figure had gone.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!”  “She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!” “Ill-informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish- colored again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

... She’s found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he’ll stand a good chance now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

More footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He would be risking expulsion again... Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster’s absence.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.
Expected: 2

Expected: 5

“Let’s — let’s find the others.

But what would he write?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“No, Harry, it’s gotta be now ... while ev’ryone’s lookin’ the other way...
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness of Bartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still Missing — Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left — it had stopped working.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.” Harry raised his wand higher.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Jc Jc Jc Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, but it was empty,  showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked loudly, over Winky’s sobs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

... Oh, I wish they’d shut up!” “All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry’s hands, flooding the floor.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books — well done.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful — but certainly not angry and scared.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Anything at all.” Harry didn’t know what to say.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward.” “Bode ...” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Ron!
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I’m fine.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“No,” croaked Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Nor am I, if it comes to that ... but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather avoid.” “If they save Harry — ” “ — then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley wearily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in person,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“I can see it!” Harry yelled.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until  breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion- Making.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But before Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice calling his name.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

She ... she will like to see you.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

usually inspired in her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.”  AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I know that name.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“I’m not ill,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts, and his fat pony.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour ...
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss.” That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Got your autograph books?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“And that’s where ...” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“I’m not hungry.” Harry felt terrible.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

And now, bedtime.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A Firebolt ...” Classes started again the next day.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious expressions.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Sit down,” said Dippet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Ron stopped dead.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of its owner.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

. . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“It was very quick.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Leave the others ...” “No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large bubbles came out.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But we definitely injured Rodolphus.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

A weapon you could use against the Ministry?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Okay then ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Would Malfoy believe what he had seen?
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Listen to me.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Two  tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast.
Expected: 6

“He wasn’t a teacher.” “But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away.
Expected: 3

Then he turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I still want to see him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“I tried, Draco.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

I’d even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think there was some Dark Magic going on — ” “ Exactly !
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Snape’s sneer became more pronounced.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

There was nobody else to ask.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

ATTACK!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in there.” Because Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He appeared to have transfigured himself — but badly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Go and wash them before dinner, please...” Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his Transfiguration homework.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The longer he looked, the more there was to see.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
Expected: 5

I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.

Professor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter — a word, if you please.” Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk.

The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise  directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added.

“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she ... er ... well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too ...” “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry.

“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon’s beak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status — meaning that they  have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.” Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either.

The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.

Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.

Are you actually as stupid as you look?” “Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted.

They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily Prophet.

Pretending he hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.

A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.

Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find us?” “No ...

They reached the dark landing.

Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.

“He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.” “Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.
Expected: 4

...” Harry’s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes.
Expected: 5

I saw you.

Not just any dwarfs, however.

He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.

“We’ll take separate stalls.” Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.

With his glasses off, the occasional fire-work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky.

How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies ... well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it?

He had a plan.

He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, “Rennervatel” Winky stirred feebly.

There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the dementors — and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him.

And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.” “What about the Astronomy tower?

We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten.

Expected: 6

“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous.
Expected: 7

Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them.
Expected: 5

“Thank you, Harry.

Who’d want to break into your office?” “A student, I daresay,” said Snape.

“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,” said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons.

Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it.

Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.

There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable.

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime after that was much too late.

It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road.

“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ” Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him.

Look — read that, there.” She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling.

He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.

“No,” she said sharply.

There was another blinding flash of light and then — It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree.
Expected: 3

“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly.

“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.

Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.

“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said Ron.

Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around.

“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened his mouth.

Harry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe’s into the last one.

“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice.

One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.

You’ll be back with  your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, “ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl” But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched  toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort’s shattered soul.
Expected: 6

“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?” The hall looked spectacular.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“We’ve been betrayed.

He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as though desperate to free himself.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“So ... ,” said Snape softly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux?” “I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption.
Expected: 7

Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.

Dead Harry ... “Mrs.

There will be no more evening activities.” The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence.
Expected: 2

“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?” “No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Harry couldn’t believe it — he was free.
Expected: 2

That’ll tell you all you need to know.” “Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’ve got to do it!

Hermione looked indignant.

“Mr.

Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?” Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“What did you call them all back for?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly.

Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.

Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited.
Expected: 2

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref!

Actual: 3

Surely that meant they’d try again?
Expected: 1

“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking up his letter.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up.
Expected: 2

“Very quiet, now ...” They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark.
Expected: 7

For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry wasn’t listening.

Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.
Expected: 7

Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state.

“And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice.

“I have no hesitation in saying  that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle.” There was a knock on the door.
Expected: 3

Harry and Ron looked quickly around too.
Expected: 4

All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, no, it couldn’t be But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs — “Mrs.

But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll.

Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.

“But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night.

He had just saved Harry’s life.

Can’t you tell I’m George?” “Sorry, George, dear.” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went.

He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at him, his wand raised.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Felix Felicis?” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
Expected: 4

“But ... well ... think about it.

But you see?

She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.

“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior out of the shadows.

Hagrid was watching him sadly.

Something we can build on ...” They sat down together at the Gryffindor table.

Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!” Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when  he was awake.
Expected: 5

“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said Hermione briskly.
Expected: 2

“Nothing.

It seemed to be mended.

Harry and Ron wheeled round.
Expected: 1

As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.” Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.

Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.

There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.

“You’re kidding!” said Harry.

It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream.

There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle.

Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room.

“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn’t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself.

I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted.

Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.

“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled Snape.
Expected: 3

Look at Neville Longbottom — he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.” “An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now — when, without warning, he ran into something very solid.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?
Expected: 7

But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.

It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it.

I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles — ” “It wasn’t me — and how did he know?” “He works for the Ministry,” said Ron.

If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be no question of being separated from their Diddykins.

Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke.

Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak.

They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk.

“You’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron.

“You want to get to bed, Harry.

It was a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well.

Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered Uncle Vernon.

He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No time, Harry — just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!” Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.

He did not need her to finish her sentence.

Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.

“Ron and Ginny say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s.” “They do, do they?” said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny.

“So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” “You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose?

... “Go and fetch Snape.” “Snape, m-my Lord?” “Snape.

Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it.

“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“No idea,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“This is funny.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.
Expected: 7

Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.

Actual: 7

“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You- Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated confusion.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The dungeon was ringing with applause now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

C’mere and help!” With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Well — you can come with one of us!” “No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“But ... from what I could see ... it looked like him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Harry Potter,” he said very softly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

. . you know ...
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Did you eat enough?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Polyjuice Potion.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.” A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“This will do, Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said hoarsely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

But no matter ... We begin again, from now.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

If he makes one more crack about my family, I’m going to get hold of his head and — ” Ron made a violent gesture in midair.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He really gets this room.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

... Oh, here’s George.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Hello, Harry Potter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Yet you say you have some names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

A fine wand- maker, though the styling is never quite what I . . . however ...” He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I’m talking about earlier.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” And Harry let go.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising — “RiddikulusV’ cried Parvati.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.” Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Yes, here we are.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“As we know, he failed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn’t it?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

They exchanged a last look, a last nod.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“What the — ?” He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment  has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The lower rocks were slippery with seawater.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He needs quiet!” “Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?” “This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,” said Dumbledore simply.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Then someone shouted through the quiet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!” “What are they shouting about?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And they drove.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Well, you won’t be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?” “Extra lessons with Snape?” said Ron, sounding aghast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

You’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry?
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

It was a different world.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

A story was given out that the girl had died  in a freak accident They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut But I knew it could happen again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“The Great Humberto’s on tonight.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, “we’ aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by a security troll, so — ” “I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He was still holding Ginny’s old  Transfiguration book.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.” “Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“She wants me looked at, doesn’t she?
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Forgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Hermione ’s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as  well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Yes!” he whispered, moving toward them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough stand on student safety.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urged him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Where had they gone?
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What’s going on?”  “They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Get in the house.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Lavender — will you go with Ron?” “She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

...
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

You were there — you heard me “I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

. . tall and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort’s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like his wife.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“I’ve got people looking, of course ...” (About time, thought Harry) “and it’s all very strange.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I bet they 11 be queuing up to go with you.” In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask exploded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I’ve been watching them all day.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Someone was creeping along the passage.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?” She hesitated.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!” She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ...” “Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti\” A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Well, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d talked in days — about how no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron’s jealousy ...  "... and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

And I ...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Maybe this is the task they’re going to get you.” “Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione ’s eye peering through the keyhole.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They shut out sound completely.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...” He raised the wand — Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s name on it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake\ He looked positively delighted about it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

...” Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Impedimental Incarcerousl ” A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Broken ropes trailed from both ankles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children’s.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Mum — Bill!” said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“We’ve won.” And he fainted.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule- breaker.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Lupin swallowed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“The silver doe.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

It’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.”  “Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Yes ... the first task ...” He moved forward into the firelight.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” She said all this very fast.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby ... Dobby ...” even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“They should be all right.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“The curse didn’t even make it into the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

All the same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral was  not decent.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

This time was different.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Miss Granger?” “Bowtruckles,” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I want to know — ” But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Floo Network office — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.” “Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fudge heartily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out of her carriage window.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!” “Untrue!” wheezed Doge.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It looked very solid.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off  the desks.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“It’s okay.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite  as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How do you know?” “Asked him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

...” “But — but — ” “My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Ron!
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Gaunt screamed, “Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!” Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He cleared his throat and said, “Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature — ” “It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys’ punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

We must win!” “Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly alarmed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s father.” Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

There was a sudden hush.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“And where have those girls got to?” She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Me too, Harry, me too!”  “No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Rita Skeeter had just entered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“We’re the only ones left who haven’t got anyone — well, except Neville.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...  “Lumos,” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald ’s next movements is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!” “Sorry, Professor — ” “I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“So he wanted me to come and get it, did he?
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I mean, you’re a prefect, aren’t you?” “Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

His heart plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall?
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Just as it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading the others over the threshold.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

If it turns out it wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: It was now or never.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He looked back at the map.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

You go on without me.” “Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no one’s going to know it’s you — ” “No — really — I don’t think I’ll come.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Upstairs!
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Nothing changed when they left school.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“ ’Course not ... this is something else.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“What d’you mean, your Bludger?
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Are you expecting a letter?” “I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Harry — yer a wizard.” There was silence inside the hut.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Ron looked as though he’d just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

I’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke Shop.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

... Well, good luck!” She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Where to start!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He was smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

In the meantime, the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Look, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests.
Expected: 6

“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes.

The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window.

“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.

What’s Dumbledore playing at?” “And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said Ron darkly.

Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.

“Er — not tomorrow.

“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t ... you keep it.” Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening.

“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two.

It looked very old.

He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.

There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground.

To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.

Who had sent the cloak?

At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash.

The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness.

A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.

Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.

Bella merely laughed.

“Think, now ...”  Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.

Come on, Harry,” she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, “let’s try that Shield Charm again.” Sirius was sending daily owls now.

“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,” said Lupin.

“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels, making the floorboards quake.

“I want three-hundred- and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” “How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.

He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,” “magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.

Actual: 7

He did not even know what all of them were.

“There’s a way, Harry.

And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us  these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.

He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.

This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.

For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.
Expected: 2

I can feel it.

Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.

Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it.

“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...” Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.

Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience.

“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.

In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.

“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.

The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
Expected: 3

He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t help it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best friends.

“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Expected: 4

We’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it — ” Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.

“Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going to be late for Binns.

Tap.

I cannot approach any nearer than this.

It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons.

“So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?” came Madam Rosmerta’s voice.

He held up his wand, muttered, “Lumos\” and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway.

Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling.

Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.

“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her.

He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now.

Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione ’s grip.

Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.”  Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there.

Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts — It’s Magid And unless Harry’s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was “Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.” Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan.

Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years — “Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy at all.

But just as  they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme — “Potter!

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here.

“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.

The smell was quite disgusting.

“My master came for me.

Nobody was talking.

“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.

“Right.” “I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons.

Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room.

At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger.

Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do, he had no idea.

“We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!” “What?” said Harry.

Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room.

When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny.

After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.

Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench.

Ha!” Aberforth spat into the fire.

Remus Lupin stood nearest to him.

But if it is,” he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” “Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back.

Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.

There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra one hundred and fifty points.

For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore.

The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be.

“Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an’ she went an’ had Grawp here — ” “Grawp?” said Harry.

She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly.

“Password?” “Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.

“Percy, you can’t do anything for him!

’S long as we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.” Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces.

Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs, and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.

“I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.” He saw Fred and George look at each other.

As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!” “It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly.
Expected: 6

You’ll be supporting Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily.

As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.

Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson.

“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of the castle once you’d yelled and woken people up,” said Harry thoughtfully.
Expected: 3

“Sorry, didn’t see her!” A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s club at the back of Flint’s head.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces.
Expected: 7

Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand.

“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and down.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lord’s name?” “Nod a laugh,” said Ron.
Expected: 7

Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.

“Y-you cast that doe?” “What?

It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time of their lives.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees.

Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.

“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.

Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.
Expected: 5

Then several people screamed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

There are parts of it even I don’t understand!
Expected: 3

Every nerve in Harry’s body was tingling unpleasantly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The office door opened.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron darkly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

...” There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them.

The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.” Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth.
Expected: 3

“This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It too opened at his touch... And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun- glass spheres... Now Harry’s heart was beating fast with excitement...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father.

The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either.

Unfounded accusations levelled ... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not...” She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

She looked uneasy.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Never at Hogwarts.

Expected: 5

But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.

The dementor’s icy fingers were closing on his throat — the high- pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death, Harry.
Expected: 5

In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.

“Wish she’d hurry up ...” Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.

They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes.

Voldemort was ready.

They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.

“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence.
Expected: 6

He did not care about being rude.

“I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just  started here myself.

“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it.

Expected: 4

“He’s me, see?” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

No!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors — perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked — He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said Sirius harshly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I don’t know who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff He paused at this point, thinking.

“I know lots of people don’t like it.

Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.

“ What involvement?” Fudge grimaced.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bellatrix.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Expected: 2

“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, “you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

I shall not permit it.” “Excuse me?” Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“It’s pathetic.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more  flustered with each visit.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.

Either we’ve got Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” “So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know.
Expected: 7

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He looked up, his heart hammering.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“By yourself?” “ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

But you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs. Weasley’s was a mistake anyone could make.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

How — how did you — ?” “Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve learned to Apparate!” “ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry.

Come closer!” Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.

Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.
Expected: 7

” “What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at Ron.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of  moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

. . have mercy .
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Here you are, then, here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!” Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Where?” said Ron quickly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” “Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact — but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers — ” “I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid.
Expected: 3

A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or something?” “I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly.
Expected: 5

“Yes, alive,” said Fudge.
Expected: 6

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.

Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Yes, yes, I know what you’re thinking!

She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“You can’t kill him,” he said breathlessly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I’ve got to go to the library!” And she sprinted away, up the stairs.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice.
Expected: 4

Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there!

Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22).

“Ill do it, I’m — ” He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?

“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor McGonagall heavily.
Expected: 2

And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked .
Expected: 4

Then he turned slowly on the spot.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“It would’ve been really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was there.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Where are we burying him?” he asked.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

‘Tm ... here ...” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“I dunno, some Ministry hag.” Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“O’ course I can’t,” he said.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

And cleverness!
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Here,” said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs he said, “Finite.” The spell was lifted.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Come on,” Ron muttered.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good evening.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

There was no stamp.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“No — I didn’t — ” Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Not until I have had my say,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

...” Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words.
Expected: 7

“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage — “are you ready yet?” “Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?” “So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?” said Harry.

Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’ll say good-bye now, then, and—” There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Nothing whatsoever happened.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you won’t let them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Hermione ignored them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I only hope we can find someone to follow ...” Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He banged on Hermione’s door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?” “Only once,” said Hermione, stung.
Expected: 5

“I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron — ” Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.

I’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have — ” “ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said Hermione nastily.

Actual: 7

... You knew that I had left the school?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“There’s something I need to do.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat: There was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Hasn’t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry?
Expected: 3

I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.” “The locket!” said Harry loudly.

His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle’s boatlike shoes.

“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying happily.

A sudden yelp told her she had done her job.

“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted.
Expected: 6

“She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will.

Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him.

We’ll be sending what’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink face went pinker.

“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley’s.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead.

“There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though.
Expected: 2

Lovegood,” said Harry.
Expected: 7

On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each other.” “Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest to his forehead.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

I’ll knock off the Knut.” “But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!” “You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.” Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

...” Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.

As I doubt whether even the Half- Blood Prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance.

“Master is needing his — hie — Winky!” whimpered the elf.

To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.

Aaaaaaand — Krum\” “That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars.

“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew — ” “It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly.
Expected: 5

... Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?” “That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,” he said.
Expected: 3

Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Why don’t you come in?” “Oh ... um ... okay,” said Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“If I have discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet?
Expected: 4

Very difficult.

Anyway, it’s — it’s an awful thought that Dumbledore ’s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
Expected: 1

“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius ... Mad-Eye ... Dumbledore ... my parents.

“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!” New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin).
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It was standing on a trapdoor.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “ — your little bit of hocus-pocus.

Ron shook his head, bemused, then checked his watch.
Expected: 5

Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Dread doused Harry’s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Then he lunged at Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough.’ As long as you kept your trap shut — ” “Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, looking skeptical.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair.
Expected: 4

His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window  was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Ron gave a forced chuckle.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Peverell ...he had heard that name before.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Because of what I’ve been writing.
Expected: 7

Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Now?” Harry whispered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Surprise!” Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Well ...
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He looked utterly mad.

Actual: 7

“Go naked.

They like punishment, the Carrows.” “Like Umbridge?” “Nah, they make her look tame.

Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.
Expected: 2

Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione ’s arm and held her back.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“You know what?
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Careful!” whispered Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will continue work then.” “Fine,” said Harry.
Expected: 5

... And speaking of Snape .

The Prime Minister heard the lock click.

Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.

Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!” “I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what happened!” Harry said furiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said Fred.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“What did we just go through all that for?
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

. .
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“What’s the matter with him?” But Harry had just seen — slinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, “is Harry, Grawp!
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

You will shake hands.

She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became limp and still.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

...
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Has something gone wrong?” “Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Had they been unblemished and unmarked too?
Expected: 4

“Her son lives.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

And then he heard it again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“Hmmm ...” he said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

There was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

But ... but You-Knotu-Who can’t be near you now, can he?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And out fell — a book.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic!
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Here — ” He shoved the Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s hands.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in  Britain.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Couldn’t remember all the goblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few.

Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry.
Expected: 7

“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

He sniffed Ernie’s potion and passed on to Ron’s with a grimace.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I’m a really slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be able to make lots more.” “You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!” Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Er — all right.” He cleared his throat.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.” Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“It’s empty now — come on!” They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Quigley!
Expected: 4

“Well, then, the next question is how often we do it.
Expected: 5

“You did not do as I asked.

Harry heard none of this, though.

“Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have closed the door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Who’s bin cursed — not Ron?
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“But he knows it now.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Anyway ...” She glanced over at Ron too.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Think it’ll damage their chances.
Expected: 3

And then, what if they didn’t split up?
Expected: 6

...
Expected: 2

“Can’t be,” said Ron.
Expected: 3

A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior.
Expected: 5

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come.
Expected: 7

His leg was repaired.
Expected: 4

Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.

Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry was watching the Slytherin table.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

You can’ trust any of ’em!” Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

...” “If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue, and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they?
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

That’s what Cedric Diggory did.” “Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry indignantly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

The man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I wondered whether it hadn’t become ... you know ... him.” “It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Why ?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Your aunt and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit big for it .

The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ...” Hagrid ’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But Harry — ” “Please, Ron\ Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.” Harry held out his left hand.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak.

They’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds.

The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously.
Expected: 5

The boy began to scream.

He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him.

I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I’ve found out.

“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

However, he did let drop certain snippets.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“And how did you manage to get away?” “Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Harry turned to Hermione.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Today’s not bad ... outside all morning,” said Ron, who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Here — you’ve earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks.

He  examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.

“See yeh at the feast if we don’ drown!” First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake with Hagrid.
Expected: 4

Weren’t you?” said Colin, trotting alongside him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

...” “Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“No, you see ... Rita Skeeter” — Hermione ’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus.
Expected: 4

He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.

“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top- quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling).
Expected: 6

All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.”  Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give him any.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am.

“I don’t know where the Chamber of Secrets is.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

His stomach turned over.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Well said indeed!
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

He looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was, beamed.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“I wouldn’t’ve — she just sort of came at me — and next thing she’s crying all over me — I didn’t know what to do — ” “Don’t blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

The minutes crept by.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Don’t they realize how important — ?” “ ’Course they don’t,” said Ron.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“They oughta change the rules.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Then Percy said rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.”  “Oh, Percy\” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

The speaker was Draco Malfoy.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

His school books were very interesting.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look really suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Did he use — his thing?” Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

An’ he was loose on the grounds las’ night.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Hermione didn’t answer.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

The Owlery?” “All searched ...” “Very well, Severus.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons...” Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Can’t carry a tune to save my life.” “Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

Harry laughed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.” “Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He held his head high and went about his business as usual!
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Not even Fred and George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.” “I won’t,” said Ron into his hands.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Salazar Slytherin’s!
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie’s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“He wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.” “He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione wisely.
Expected: 5

Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.

He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were.
Expected: 6

Then the lane  curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“In the air, everyone, let’s go.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“I have no idea,” said Snape coldly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achievement,” said Ted.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Cured!” he announced brightly to the kitchen at large.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. . . . “And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He heard the door close and looked up.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Mrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter?
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“No,” said Hagrid.
Expected: 5

We don’t really need it anymore.” “And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?” said Harry.

“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do,” said Hagrid as they reached the stairs.

“Luna, can you help Ginny?” “Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up.

“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid whisper.

“Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spells.

“But a little recreation never hurt anybody.

I can make them hurt if I want to.”  His legs were trembling.

“I think so,” said Harry.

“You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again.

Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.

There was a slight stiffness in the way she said “ ’Morning,” which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
Expected: 1

He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, “Peskipiksi Pesternomti” It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
Expected: 3

“Thank you.” “Hang on...” said the wizard slowly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“But I might still be of some use to you.

Why should he be afraid of Snape?
Expected: 1

He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley said at last.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

But this was a lie.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

There must be about a hundred cups in that room.

“Nice job, I hope?

As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin ’s candle, extinguishing everything.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

I don’t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right?
Expected: 3

Hermione’s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.
Expected: 6

... As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.

“Hallows, not Horcruxes.” “Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes.
Expected: 7

...” “That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly.
Expected: 4

But I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought.

“We’ll never be here again.
Expected: 7

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight!
Expected: 7

“Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.
Expected: 1

They didn’t seem to have faces.

But you,  Tom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.” “I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Right.” “Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
Expected: 4

They were off.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.

“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.
Expected: 7

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . . One hour. . . . Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle.

I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?” “It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., Professor.” “And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject.

“And they’ve found Igor Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north.

He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father  tormenting Snape.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d have given them detention.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimental” Malfoy was blasted off his back.

Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else.

He realized he must be in the hospital wing.

She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.

“Yes,” said Ron.

... Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.
Expected: 7

“You’re the Gray Lady?” She nodded but did not speak.

“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry.
Expected: 2

“McGonagall wants you, Ron.

“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron.
Expected: 5

Every time Harry imitated her, looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him.
Expected: 7

“Arthur and I have been worried about you, too.
Expected: 2

“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.
Expected: 2

The library was pitch-black and very eerie.
Expected: 1

“Told yeh, nuthin said Hagrid firmly.
Expected: 5

“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry’s face, “that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.” Harry nodded again.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Why?” “I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George.
Expected: 2

The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“D’you think I don’t know what people call me behind my back?
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.
Expected: 1

“Resign?” Wood thundered.
Expected: 1

Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees.
Expected: 7

Harry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Oh — really?” said Harry.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Hey, Harry” — Ron gave a great whoop of laughter — “Malfoyl Wait till he sees you on this!
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady’s corridor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

... Take your time, now ... then tell me what you see within it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Inside,” he said.

It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all “Oh, did he now?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Oh, Ron, how wonderful!
Expected: 5

“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage.
Expected: 4

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone.
Expected: 1

“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“You’re not ... his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

Wasted away just like the boy.

“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione ’s rigid face.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?” “Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.

Actual: 3

... I’d want revenge.’ ” “You’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours?” said Ron furiously.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s time — ” “No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore’s arrival.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He was shaking and out of breath.
Expected: 1

Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, you’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

But Harry couldn’t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

I wouldn’t cross her!” Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

A few hexes wouldn’t go amiss either.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And despite Ron’s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.

If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!

“Harry!

“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the holidays.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

Or per’aps, you hoped?” said Fleur, her nostrils flaring.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He is too great, too good, to lose.

“It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?” “Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill- disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean — ” “ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask — ” “You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” said the hat smartly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Ron, what are you staring at?” “Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry.
Expected: 1

Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

No weeping Hagrid?” “No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Ill h-hit you, I swear I will!” “Dudley, shut — ” WHAM A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off his feet.

“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?” “Professor Snape, dear.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“It is an odd case, possibly unique.
Expected: 6

The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“And what will become of those whom you command?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn’t want to.
Expected: 4

“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge.
Expected: 7

“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?” Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet.

Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty.
Expected: 2

“If?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the alarm clock.” By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“How’re the cauldron bottoms coming on?” “Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

That sword was Ragnuk the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor!
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”  “I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Doesn’t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he’s got lumbago.” He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it.
Expected: 4

Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.

“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.
Expected: 1

Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets, and food from the pantry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy Widdershins was lying, was he?
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!” “I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I like a healthy breeze ’round my privates, thanks.” Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.
Expected: 4

“Yes.

They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.

“Yeh’ll be amazed.

George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.
Expected: 3

“How’re you?
Expected: 6

“Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping Hagrid on the shoulder.
Expected: 3

Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.
Expected: 1

They left the stadium right away.
Expected: 3

Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes.
Expected: 6

“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.” Petunia turned scarlet.
Expected: 7

By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ” “I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.

Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape.

Use it well, the note had said.
Expected: 1

“ ‘Really grumpy’?” Ron raised his eyes to the heavens.

The elf was doing something very odd.

“Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors.

Or has Dumbledore sent you here?

Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats.
Expected: 3

“Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you.

“It’s not a very common gift.

Hermione put up her hand.

I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out .

“I notice they haven’t made you two prefects.” “What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking revolted at the very idea.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.” Harry smiled feebly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me.

Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.” “Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.

They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years.

“You dueled with the Dark Lord?” “Got away .

“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,” said Riddle.
Expected: 2

They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Look.” And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.
Expected: 6

“He was out of his mind,” said Harry.
Expected: 4

“Erm,” said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Mum’s getting edgy.” They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7

There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Right then,” he said, glancing around them.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

A scandal!
Expected: 1

The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.
Expected: 6

“Anyway — good work, everyone.
Expected: 3

Well, I don’t think much of your manners, My Lord.
Expected: 4

“Those two!” she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Whichever term you prefer.” “But then ... do you mean ...” said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?” Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Lord Voldemort will provide.
Expected: 4

“Well go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas.
Expected: 7

So why would I want this one?
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“I won’t have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

I hope this is one of those times.” He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

No!
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention- seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one’s convenience.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Nothing,” Harry lied.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
Expected: 1

“But where’s — ?” “Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.
Expected: 5

“My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!”  “We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny lately,” said Hermione quickly.
Expected: 2

You hear him?
Expected: 5

Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught.
Expected: 5

“Good sense of when to duck, more like ...” He was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking.

All Harry’s — it was incredible.

You’ve got a visitor.
Expected: 6

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately.
Expected: 5

The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear.

It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges.

A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his sleep.

Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky.

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad.

“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked.
Expected: 4

...” “What?” said Harry quickly.
Expected: 3

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.

Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface.

At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.
Expected: 7

“Look, Hermione, can’t you — ?” “No, I can’t,” she said flatly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

And where’s Malfoy?
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Me!” said Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later ... and then he saw it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

If so, he had been wrong.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

(Hermione’s parents were dentists.)

A warm breeze swept the alleyway.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I — ” “I said shut up!” Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“I’ve got to train, Professor!” Professor McGonagall considered him intently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“A no- account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who — ” “He was not,” said Harry suddenly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” Snape made a small, disparaging noise.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I shall make sure that person is expelled.” Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression.
Expected: 2

Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know, I was sitting there waiting for them.

Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker.

“HAGRID, COME BACK!” But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Perhaps they thought there were  more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.

“And — it — had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him — why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!” “Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head, cowering.

Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again.” Harry scrambled to his feet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

... It’s not r-really important .
Expected: 6

...” And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It was the Mirror of Erised.
Expected: 1

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.

“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.

“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron.
Expected: 5

“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Or are you on that list under a different name?
Expected: 7

It hurt because ... he’s ... angry.” Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them — yet he knew at once that they were true.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings.
Expected: 4

“Because — because — ” Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, “because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day?

And then she left the cousin’s house to go south and see an aunt .

Yet it couldn’t be that long ago .

It was much warmer in here.

“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train.

“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron.

Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.

“Yes, My Lord, yes ...

But there were around a dozen doors here.

“Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a trick, that man.

“Difficult.

One of them was smoking a long pipe.

He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“But the Daily Prophet’s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it.

We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds.

Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily.
Expected: 7

He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

I know you’re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak.

ATTAAAACK!” Crash — crash — crash — door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out.
Expected: 2

“We’ll be checking that.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

For a moment, there was silence.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, “leave now, please!” There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Or you?” “Definitely not.” “Oh.” Harry stared into the fire.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

“N-nothing.” The pain had gone as quickly as it had come.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Moran!
Expected: 4

“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose — ” said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort’s eyes.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“ ‘Darling,’ he called her.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

“Harry — ” “Look.

They didn’t say anything at all.

“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says Skeeter.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has she?”  “Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Ron’s eyes widened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

No!” And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without  seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I’ve got a clean record.

“I dunno ...

Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him.

For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling.

“You say one.”  “You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently.

Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet.

...” “I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn’t’ve messed around with wands — I’d’ve ripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled.

Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together.

“P- Petunia?” She raised her head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“If she just acted like she was sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione.
Expected: 3

A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Look at this one ...” He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: “ ‘I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next  post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’ Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.” Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . . “ Dobby ?” said Harry incredulously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who the blazes is calling at this time of night?” Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Come here She raised her wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off the dried blood.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Oh, hi, Luna.” “I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, rummaging in her bag.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

Harry turned his back on the front door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

You look pale.

Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr.

Pleased, but surprised.

Actual: 6

They couldn’t be here... Not in Little Whinging ...
Expected: 5

They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

You two’ve got them, too,” he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid happily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

That’s very, very advanced magic.

Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to say, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you.

“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry.

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time.

“Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we are...”  A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we’ve lost Hagrid too...” They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I’d better put it upstairs — ” “I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry asked her.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.
Expected: 1

They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know.

Then he crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

He ran the other way, back past his staring companions.
Expected: 5

“That’s from my father.

And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves.

Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open.
Expected: 5

... Are you all right?” “Yes,” Harry heard himself say.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

You are embarrassing us.” But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking backward and forward on her trunk in paroxysms of grief.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Pretty, isn’t it?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

They had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort.
Expected: 3

“We’ve been working like house-elves here!” Hermione raised her eyebrows.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I’ve never seen him like that before.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Oh, wow!
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“And quickly.” She strode toward the door and held it open for him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed troll ...” “Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I bet they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“ ‘I open at the close ...’ What’s that supposed to mean?” Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if  a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s floor.

It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.

I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.” Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary.

That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors.
Expected: 5

Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after- dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason’s head, and swooped out again.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

... Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf.

“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione?
Expected: 6

Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . .
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Harry, guess what?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

And then he found someone’s toes and pressed down upon them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said Percy, going very red in the face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Snape interrupted him.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron’s grip.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I don’t want — ” “But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the Ministry?” “It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“He did,” she said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book?
Expected: 6

She was making notes on her clipboard now.

“You wait, when I’m seventeen — ” “I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred.

“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.

“Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?” he asked.

“You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known.

See what I mean?

“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, terror in her face.
Expected: 5

He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.

They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
Expected: 1

Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.

You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.” “But I don’t despise you — ” “Then you should,” said Dumbledore.

“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ” Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened.

“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.

He sank onto the bed opposite the others.

Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school.

Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Neville?” Hermione said gently.
Expected: 4

“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.

Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.

“Now — be warned!
Expected: 2

“Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room.
Expected: 2

“What do you see?” Harry screwed up his courage.
Expected: 1

Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling.

“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly Headless Nick.

A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg.

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.

But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?

On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders — “And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, “is why you should never go for looks alone!” Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above.

Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.

It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.” Harry took the map and grinned.

It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.

“I-I think so,” she said shakily.

Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?

Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand.

“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!” Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes.

Harry swallowed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!” Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond “usual evil.” “Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron asked.

Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard.

They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.

He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth.
Expected: 6

Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times he passed her in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room), muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands, and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry.

“Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ” “Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.

Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
Expected: 3

“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.

Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.

He flung back his head and stared at the sky.

He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, “HERMIONE!

He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.

“What’re those things?” whispered Ron.

Nobody seemed to want to touch him.

“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly.

He had already packed most of his things.

Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
Expected: 5

House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house.

They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was a clear, starry night.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Hagrid’s chair was deserted too; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but Snape’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break.

“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Mad?” said Percy airily.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what was dangerous.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus.
Expected: 7

He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.

“Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital.

How was this possible?
Expected: 7

Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.

“You ask him!” “No, you!” “I’ll do it!”  And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.

Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

An old man’s mistake ...” Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore made eye contact.

“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James.

The monster in his chest purred ... but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like “betrayal of trust” .
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time ... this way,” he added, “I think it’s down here.

“Probably,” said Ron.

“Anyway, Harry, you’re interfering with reception.
Expected: 5

Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely ... At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.” Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.

I’ll kill you!

“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.

“So, what’s been going on?” “Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s, haven’t I?” “Come off it!” said Ron.
Expected: 6

“I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?” “I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” Something in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do believe me, don’t you?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.

They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.

His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites.

“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron.

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.

“Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,” Harry said to Hermione.

“See why I’ve got to go back to Hogwarts?

When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.

“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.

“How can I ever thank — ” “GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.

“Well go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.

“Look for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara!

“ You’ve got to come back ini” “Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply.

Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation.

“Think how many Canary Creams that is.” The twins stared at him.

Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s office, and closed the door behind him.

The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark.

“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall.

“If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.” “Don’t you dare speak to Draco like — ” said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed,  “Be quiet!

He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast.

“And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.” “How has that helped?” Harry asked.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Died years ago, didn’t he?” Riddle frowned.
Expected: 6

Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them.

Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.

Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ ... but he would not go.

Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces.

A small crowd of people, some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.

Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh ; on the right-hand side, short queues of  wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.

These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!” “I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling.

Greyback specializes in children.

There were plenty of animals he wouldn’t want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn’t the answer.

... And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara.

“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.

“I don’t know what we’d do without you.” She beamed, but became solemn at once.

Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat.

The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him — ”  Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.

The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.

Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.

When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.

He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.

“ The last thing to mend,’ ” Harry repeated.

Sir?” “The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,” said Snape.

He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione’s table.

Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I mean, you didn’t need to save that little Delacour girl... You got a bit ... carried away ...” A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry’s body — how could she remind him of that blunder now?

Okay, let’s go.

They were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in  a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.

I hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for.

“Keep her — them — safe.

Okay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!” Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms.
Expected: 2

Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy were now neck and neck .
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

It’s just that it’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention.

Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.

“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat.

“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate gesture.

When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.

Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again .

Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of  Malfoy, ready for the fight.

Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap.

His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.

Actual: 7

“It’s all over,” he said.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.

“How d’you know that?” “It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string.

“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terrified.
Expected: 7

Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.

The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.

“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched voice.

“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up.

Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon.

I’ve done more than either of them\ But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations... Maybe he chooses them for other reasons... Ron must have something you don’t... Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night.

And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars!

“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.

“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.

Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there.

He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.

After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
Expected: 7

“But it’s nothing...

A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue  with a thousand more black candles.

“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule.

When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What?” said Harry and Ron together.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified.
Expected: 7

Yew.

I think — ” He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing.

% who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

We can’t send him an owl.” “I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

... You found him inside yourself.” And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

Then they saw that his waist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,” said George.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Harry seized it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Get off, Ron!”  Hermione pulled out her wand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?” “Harry, we weren’t — ” “Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Yes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Harry Potter, at my deathday party!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Four, Hermione,” said Ginny, scowling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

She went very red and muttered “hello” without looking at him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.” “There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts?
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

But there isn’t much life left in her.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

There are strange likenesses between us, after all.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

...” “Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,” Hermione said severely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

...” “I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I’d already done it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

A tingling sensation was spreading throughout him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Any others?” said Crouch coldly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?” “It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Three seconds ... two seconds ... one second ... “It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

If I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how much you’ve learned.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“You’re not going to go inside?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“It is ready, Master.” “Now ...” said the cold voice.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive  only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

And what model is it?”  “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” Ron muttered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?” Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Well, Severus?
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor table.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Oh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight...” Something about Phineas ’s voice was familiar to Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

. . Harry longed to bite the man .
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Then she turned to the twins.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Who’s there?” he shouted.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

“Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Yes,” she said.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter — He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but — “Argh!” Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry’s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry’s wand — “NO YOU DONT!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned — “Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.” He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

‘Never had to tell him off in four years?’ she  said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry’s schedule.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.” “If you’re talking about Lupin ...” Harry began.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Control your anger, discipline your mind!
Expected: 5

“I’m allowed to walk across the grounds,” he said pointedly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Not good,” said Bill.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“The man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny’s dead weight.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He didn’t want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody’s head.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?” Neville looked startled, but said, “Well ... always the same hat.
Expected: 3

Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

“And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?” “S’right,” said Gaunt.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

“I don’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student!
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

No choice.” “What do you mean?” “I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts.
Expected: 7

He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“What about my scar?” “ What?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion looked like bogies.” “Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Let him rest.” Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius’s words.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“She’s cried a fair few times, yeh know.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You ... you wouldn’t understand.” “Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were someone I knew.” “But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
Expected: 6

“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Running around in the dark with a werewolf!
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?” But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Mum!” said Fred as though he’d only just spotted her and seizing her hand too.
Expected: 3

“Writing!

“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.
Expected: 7

“Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?” “Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Good evening,” said Ronan.
Expected: 1

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

“My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic!
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.” The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Not really,” said Ron slowly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see it at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The prospect of moving him was daunting.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Come along ... hospital wing ...” “No,” said Dumbledore sharply.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

It just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at the other end.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“What’s wrong?” said Hermione.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

We’ll be off, then.” Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“RON?” Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“Yes, Molly dear,” said Mr. Weasley meekly.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do you!” The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

There was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I will not stop you.”  Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He does tend to — what was that?” A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Even Fawkes had fallen silent.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.” Fudge still had that strange smile on his face.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“Sorry, Colin, I’m in a hurry — Quidditch practice — ” He climbed through the portrait hole.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Stan was watching Harry’s stunned face with great enjoyment.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

...” “Go away,” Percy snapped.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,” Mr. Malfoy told our reporter.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, “Renneruate.” Krum opened his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know!
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

There was only one thing for it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Careful there, Miss Fawcett.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Yes, the last and worst.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

I was annoyed you woke me up!
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Not?” repeated Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

Where were Fleur and Krum?
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Winky’s lip quivered.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux — ” “Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!” “Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking,  and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep- blue sky.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“He’s got no power ter overrule the Committee.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend!
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or — ” “You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“Died years ago.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

"... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions — good girl!
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

THE BRIBE If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But then — “Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I wish I could.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Use it well.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window  and peered down into the front garden.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“He looks like he wants you to grab hold ...” said Ron, looking perplexed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“It’s her\” Ron whispered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Should be a laugh, eh?” “I dunno,” said Harry.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione.” “I’m not,” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him!
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Shall we get going then?”  “Oh yes,” she said happily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

It’ll happen anyway — ” “No — ” Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Can I have a frog?
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Hagrid ’s fingers.” At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?” It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s speech.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It had a  shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

What will happen to Bill?” “We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

You said the Dark Lord — ” “I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said Professor Trelawney.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

After about fifty yards, they reached a fork.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He likes the quiet life.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Yeah.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

... Tell me about your Patronus.” “How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Harry moved his head over on the pillow.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

It rings a bell...” “We saw him,” Hermione whispered.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Well?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled joyfully.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Vernon Dudley.” “Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, instead.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

I don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!” It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

A hush fell over the onlookers.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

It was Peeves.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.” “Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now.

He took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well, very well ... cleared of all charges.” “Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish.

Actual: 7

Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.
Expected: 1

They all ducked.

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Probably mistaken the day.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

If there’s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.” He gave another bow and left.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

And ... and we suspect giant involvement.” The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s neck stand up.

Actual: 5

Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Stand away from the door.
Expected: 7

Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“I haven’t got ten Galleons.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

The old woman’s face blanched.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.” Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

. . for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Sneaking around on your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?” Harry shrugged.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Lily rounded on Snape.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes — ” “Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was real, I didn’t imagine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got to find out where he is...” Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

And I have destroyed another.”  “You have?” said Harry eagerly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since  learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night’s hunting with a mouse in its beak.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“Well just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“What now?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

...” He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks.” “What happened?” “The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Dean swore loudly.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“Errol\” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“ ’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

...” The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“You’d have to ask Loony.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Buckbeak is going to be executed.”  THE QUIDDITCH FINAL “He — he sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out the letter.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“No,” he said.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

I knew him at once .
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

He had hurried straight toward row number ninety- seven, turned left, and ran along it...
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it?
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

You make me SICK.” She turned on her heel and hurried away.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Maple and phoenix feather.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders;  the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Take your time.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing anything!” The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay... Say that again with a straight face.”  “I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

They went, as quickly as they could without actually running.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she said.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.” Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!” The candles all went out at once.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He didn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

I’d have died of fear if I’d been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Diggory,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You- Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

If anything, it was mine.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Rather thicker than one usually sees .
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Anyway She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Harry, Fred, and George followed.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

None of them has died yet.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Bit of a comedown for Mr.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry’s parents’ wedding.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

The scene dissolved again.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Cedric and his parents were just inside the door.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“It was brilliant!
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Yes,” said Harry.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

An’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Nah, he can’t have.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

Hedwig had been absent for two nights now.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

Use it if you need me, all right?
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley?
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“Look ... at ... me.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

So I’m taking loads of pictures to send home to him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

“What if it ignited?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking hands.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” “Wow,” said Ron.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Harry grinned back.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

Harry saw it spill over his chin onto his chest.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

Harry couldn’t help it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Peter Pettigrew faked his own death!
Expected: 3

“There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!” “I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Trouble usually finds me.” “How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?” said Ron shakily.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“We’d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.”  For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before.
Expected: 7
Actual: 4

“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

It’ll help.” Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

. . friends .
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“You are not.” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“How are you?” “Fine,” Harry lied.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes — ” “Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione from the doorway.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.” “Excellent.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

His face was livid with terror.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.” He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.” They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.” Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Books can take you only so far in this field.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

...” For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.” “And then what?” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 3

WHAM.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“Nothing,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

THE MIRROR OF ERISED Christmas was coming.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

Twice it failed.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

If you have not already given  serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

I knew you hadn’t worked out the egg’s clue, so I had to give you another hint — ” “You didn’t,” Harry said hoarsely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Now Percy’s a prefect.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and “Not at all!”s.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.” “But Dumbledore doesn’t want — ” “Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Harry Potter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.” Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Once more the wall spun and became still again.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances ...” He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

But,” she lowered her voice to a whisper, “bit of a danger to himself, bless him... Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t remember how to get back.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

Our department’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he glanced at Harry — “was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don’t you think?” “Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been enormous fun.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Come here, I need you to take my answer back!” The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Dare he make a break for it?
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

Within seconds, Katie’s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“Oh,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

“What if he’s — ?” “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“There have been another couple of dementor attacks,” he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.” “But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ”  “Jordan, I’m warning you — ” “All right, all right.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.
Expected: 1
Actual: 4

We both got here.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!” “What?
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

I’ve got the other.
Expected: 5

“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom on the first floor,” said Hermione.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

I ain’t got none of ’em left, or you could ’ave ’em — ”  “It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,” said Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

“You sent that Howler.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!” roared Bagman.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

Harry scratched his ear.
Expected: 2
Actual: 3

Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You’re late.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“What’s the matter?” “P — P — Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk.
Expected: 3
Actual: 1

“You had to act like Muggles all the way?” “Well, not exactly all the way,” said Hagrid cagily.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed.

It wasn’t very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which  Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.

He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power.

He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm.

“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!” “I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.
Expected: 7

“Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy ... of you being ‘the Chosen One’...” They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.

... “I WONT!” And these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him — back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing.

The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him.

“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called.

Think I got her persuaded.” “Is it to do with Voldemort?” Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.

“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.

Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.

They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until  he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.” “Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size.

“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried.

There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?” Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.” “Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said, staring at Hagrid.
Expected: 4

“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily changing the subject.
Expected: 2

A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.

Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others.

“Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’,” said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them.

A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.

Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair.

He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so.

“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.

“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though — ” “Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said.

From Goblin Liaison?

Harry had seen enough.

He had never been this deep into the forest before.

The following week dragged by.

Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.

“She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something.

She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

I told you it was from him!” “Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?” “No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said Lupin.
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

“A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.” “There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!” said Ron hotly.
Expected: 3

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.

A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.

There was something extremely odd going on.

“Yes,” said Dumbledore.

They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.

“That woman Kreacher’s got a photo of in his den?” There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart’s angry voice.
Expected: 5

In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits.

Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you — non-magical people,  that is — will not.
Expected: 6

“Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg.

Watch him ...” Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes.

“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry’s.

“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” said Hermione through gritted teeth.

“Dragons'.” he whispered.

Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone.

The sword clanged as Ron dropped it.

“And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match).” Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride.

Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.

“Many happy returns.” “Thanks,” said Harry.

“What’s up?” said Harry.

Then divide into pairs.

They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding.
Expected: 5

Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.

“The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes.

And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe.

“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
Expected: 6

There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.

“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, “go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again.

I supposed he bit himself.

“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up.

It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs.

“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall’s reach.

“Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!” Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.

Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party.
Expected: 2

Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?” His heart was hammering.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending?
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

“Not really,” said Harry coldly.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.” Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

This must be where Dumbledore lived.
Expected: 2

Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.” They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry’s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over,  shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty- three bones to regrow!

“It’s not much,” said Ron.

You know, I don’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven’t even started pudding.

“Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore.

“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed as Crookshanks ’s claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder.
Expected: 3

“I’m not hurt,” said Harry.
Expected: 6

“Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears.
Expected: 3

“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.” “All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both.

“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat.

“Excellent!

The time had come for drastic action.

A few people gasped.

“The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter.

Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.
Expected: 2

... A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams.

Harry was starting to feel cold.
Expected: 4

As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.
Expected: 2

“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.

He’ll know, hell find out.

“Where are we?” “In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Hermione.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

...” And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse- colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
Expected: 6
Actual: 4

...
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.
Expected: 4
Actual: 1

“Not far now!” shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing.

“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him.

... You’re going, aren’t you?” “Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re — ” There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced.

“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears.

The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.

“He’s lost — ” But the end of Mrs. Weasley ’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them.
Expected: 7

Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something.

He had not heard correctly.

“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.

Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

There was just one very small improvement — after swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night.

“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there.

Defense against external penetration?

"... has it gone?” “Oh yes!” said Dumbledore.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

Expected: 5
Actual: 7

...” “Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that,” said Ron.

To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.

“Inspired!

Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“I thought you just said — ?” “Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I don’t want to eat.” Harry scrutinized him suspiciously.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library?” “Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly.

Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.

Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione.

“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour.

“Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret ...” Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.

I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” “But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” “ ’Course,” said Neville.
Expected: 7

Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.
Expected: 2

The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.

The one thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true, he could not see how ...
Expected: 7

“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly.

Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache.

“Our examination of the grounds will not take long.” They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door.

“I can’t remember enjoying commentary more!

“So ... you lot got dates for the ball yet?” “Nope,” said Ron.

He could not see how they would know what he was talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading this letter.
Expected: 5

It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked.
Expected: 3
Actual: 4

“I bet there aren’t many living people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll be fascinating!” “Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

Where does it hurt?” He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions.
Expected: 5

Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air.

She hasn’t studied.

Hermione hitched it up out of sight.

The dementors will be coming any moment —  “Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said.

Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence.

The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.

“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.
Expected: 3

Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered haughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach — the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.” “Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door.
Expected: 7
Actual: 6

“To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!” Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere?
Expected: 6
Actual: 3

She merely smiled her mysterious smile.
Expected: 4

“Leave Scabbers alone.” The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He won’t be happy.” “Better go back,” said Yaxley.
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.

“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again.
Expected: 7

When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.

Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment.

It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.

“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron.

Harry glanced back at the photograph.
Expected: 3

“I’m okay, I’ve got a report to finish anyway...” Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

I am so glad, so honored!” In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne.
Expected: 7
Actual: 3

“Excellent.” said Fred and George together.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“She ought to be here in about five minutes.
Expected: 7

And we’ve got all our books — ” He pointed at a large bag under his chair.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

Ron seemed to notice Harry’s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.
Expected: 6

Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.

“Nobody was hurt.

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.

Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I imagine he was most interested in you.

The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch.
Expected: 6

He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the Cup\ We’ve won the Cup\” Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh- colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.

“Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.” “Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds.

“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks.

There was a murmur of interest.

Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.

To Harry’s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.

“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm.

I was often rather sharp with him.

“Password?” she said.

“I’d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.” “Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said Hermione.

“But — you must admit it’s weird.

On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house.

It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them.

If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.

He kept glancing nervously at the windows.

“But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there — ” “Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He turned quickly to the others.

“Out there wearing masks, are they?” Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.

There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do.

“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron.

“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly.

The words wouldn’t come.

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes.

Harry’s arms were wrapped tightly around his horse’s neck as he willed it to go even faster.

He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question and she knows the answer!

“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione viciously.

He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing.

“Been stung.” “Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice.

He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

“The boys wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!” “So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?” “No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there.
Expected: 6

“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry fiercely.
Expected: 5

I wonder what they’re doing with them?” Harry joined her at the tank.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said Hermione firmly.
Expected: 3

She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Do you need help?” “No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that...

“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.

“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he said quietly.

“And you, boy?” Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.

“It was tactless — ” “No, it was honest,” said Harry.

“The man who ran — ” “ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach.
Expected: 6

Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “MudbloocL.” The scene changed.

Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.

He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.

“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “ Kreacherl” There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears.

“Just one last thing, then.” And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.

As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.

His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.

“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “It — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.

“You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.” “Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.” The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else.

Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch- Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked him hard in the face.

“I know that,” said Harry quickly.

“Headaches?
Expected: 4

My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.” Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.

He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor.

When at long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall.

Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four- legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.

Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky.

Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were.

“We sent it.”  THE PORTKEY Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in Ron’s room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.

“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.

“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ”  Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home.
Expected: 2

Very strange tales they told me, too.

In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.

“We’ve been decontaminating this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here.

“I  would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land — An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing.

“It must be somebody your end ...” Harry’s heart skipped several beats.
Expected: 5

Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.
Expected: 1
Actual: 2

I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.” Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” “That’s stupid,” said Ron.

This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it.
Expected: 2
Actual: 7

“And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend — ” “But we haven’t got any!” “If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly.

“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered, more to herself than to the others.

“He’s too little.

Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

“WHO ARE YOU?” “RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Or even looked at me.” And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it.
Expected: 5

Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle.

“And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius.

I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake me.

With  difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up.

“He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them — ” “That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile.
Expected: 6

“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.

“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.

“Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and uncle!” Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.

“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione, putting the tankard away.

“They’re working him far too hard.

He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, throwing him his present.

Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore.
Expected: 3

So she’s found out someone wants to snog me too.
Expected: 6

Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall.
Expected: 2

White- hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound.

“Don’ make me say it again.

Petunia, any ideas?” “Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.

And who can say who may have defeated them?

Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages.
Expected: 2

“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry asked Ron and Hermione.
Expected: 5

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.

Harry looked away.
Expected: 4

“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?” “You weren’t there,” said Harry.

The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject.

What if they expelled her?

“But she’ll turn up.

“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly.

So what do we do, Harry?” The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.

“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.
Expected: 6
Actual: 1

He’d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he’d explain that he’d been calling the  snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again.
Expected: 4

Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark.
Expected: 5

“No!”  Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s nod had been his own death sentence.
Expected: 3

“Why, what does it mean?”  “Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.

“They’ve got ... they’ve got Ron?” “The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.
Expected: 3

...” Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing.
Expected: 2

“Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’ there they was, spread ou’ underneath us.

Harry felt wide awake — the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him.

“Give Pig something to do.

He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.

Someone screamed.
Expected: 6

He was dangerous — a madman.
Expected: 4

Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W.

“Very well, then — ” “I TOLD YOU, NO!” Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman.
Expected: 5

He’s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.” “So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” “We’re doing our best,” said Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“Get up!” said Snape sharply.
Expected: 5
Actual: 1

“Could we have .
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally.
Expected: 6
Actual: 5

“Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said shrilly.
Expected: 3
Actual: 7

Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” Harry couldn’t take it in.

The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected.

Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away.

Actual: 5

Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye  and Lupin.
Expected: 5
Actual: 3

“So — er — what did she want?” he asked in a mock casual voice.
Expected: 5
Actual: 7

‘It’s all right for him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already!
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“I mean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!” The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley’s age.
Expected: 2
Actual: 6

“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

So She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up at Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had  done.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.
Expected: 2
Actual: 4

You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?” “No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.
Expected: 3
Actual: 5

“How?” said Hermione nervously.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.” “Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

“I’ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll Mum and Dad say?” Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.
Expected: 2

Someone’s gotta tell Dumbledore!” “Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach.
Expected: 5

The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls.
Expected: 4
Actual: 7

Half blinded, he staggered backward.
Expected: 1
Actual: 7

The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.” A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry.
Expected: 7
Actual: 1

The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

I don’t recall — ” “I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,” said Snape.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes.
Expected: 4
Actual: 2

“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened.
Expected: 6

Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.

Okay, Tuesday, I’ll ... erm “Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.

“You saw him — ?” “That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely.

Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.
Expected: 5

Slipped your mind, I daresay.
Expected: 2

“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “Dunno,” muttered Dudley.

The potion turned palest pink.

“Let you have a clear field, all right?

“Here — and here — ” “Come and look at this!” said Hermione.
Expected: 2

“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Harry shook his head.
Expected: 1
Actual: 5

“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, “Well — ” “Yeah,” said Harry.
Expected: 4
Actual: 5

“No,” said Ollivander.
Expected: 7
Actual: 5

Tap.
Expected: 1
Actual: 3

His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness... A face whiter than a skull .
Expected: 5
Actual: 6

He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch.
Expected: 5
Actual: 4

Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to protect them?” “Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably.
Expected: 4
Actual: 6

Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.
Expected: 2
Actual: 1

We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own — ” “It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.
Expected: 7

“The Firebolt’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds.

The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened.
Expected: 3
Actual: 2

Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person?
Expected: 6

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.

They’re rare, them.” He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.

Percy strode briskly forward and vanished.

I set out for your parents’ house straight away.

“Very well, Mr. Potter ...

But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss.

There had been a flying motorcycle in it.

But even from above  there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks.

Would he be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage?

The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking.

The door flew open at once.

Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it?

Then Potter came, and Krum.

“Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,” mumbled Harry.
Expected: 7

BANG.

You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no?

“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,” said Voldemort.
Expected: 4

“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern.
Expected: 2
Actual: 5

His face wasn’t twitching at all.
Expected: 1
Actual: 6

“SIT BACK DOWN!” “What now?” said Harry impatiently.
Expected: 5
Actual: 2

What are you hiding here for?” “I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said Ron.

Actual: 2

Ringleaders of their little gang.

“How long have you known this — why have we been wasting time?
Expected: 7
Actual: 2

Have a good time.” He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.
Expected: 3
Actual: 6

“But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
Expected: 2

In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.

She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night.

But if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.” Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair.

“Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know...” “We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron.

The stranger reached Dumbledore.

Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the  bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them.

“C-cut it out!

He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail.

Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly, “ RiddikulusV’ Harry’s body vanished.

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry.

He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair.

They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.

They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.

Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy ... “Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless they’ve got to.” “Harry — ” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured.

“Town ahead!” They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below.

“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor.

The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon — seemed to have fallen away.

Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again.

What’re we going to do, break into Snape’s private stores?

At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs  through the common room.

Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting  what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.” She sat down.

Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled.
Expected: 4

“Hermione — I need you to help me.” “What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.

This is the wand that killed Sirius!” Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.

“He always thinks monsters aren’t as bad as they’re made out, and look where it’s got him!

Are you crazy?

“Why?” said Percy curiously.

As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face.

Have they sentenced you to anything?

“Quidditch — what is this rubbish?” Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.

Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done.

“Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?” “No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly.

But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job.

Actual: 7

“Add a clockwise stir — ” “No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped.
Expected: 6
Actual: 2

It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his  trainer as it whipped upward out of sight.
Expected: 6
Actual: 7

It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron.

She kicked him aside.

Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.

Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself.

“Hagrid, he killed ...” “Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry.

“I won’t permit it!

“Well?” she said sharply.

And her — ” “This is really funny and everything,” said Harry impatiently, “but joke’s over, all right?

Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off.

“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking.

There had been two people he knew and one he didn’t.

“Better not risk it.” “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.

“Mind you, we did save her.” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.

“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room.

“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.

He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor.

He didn’t know anything about his father’s family, after all.

“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited: “First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.

Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her.

In fact, it was fast asleep.

He blinked again.

The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack.

“Where is she?” Ron said.

Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed.
Expected: 6

“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.

The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.

“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron’s.
Expected: 3

The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.

He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear.

“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work.

“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner.

Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime.

On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.

He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light.
Expected: 4

“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too.

For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible.

He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius.

They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.” He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.

He stepped in front of it.

He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.

He could not understand how it had happened — Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm — Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore ’s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood.

Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.

Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he’d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them.

His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a  distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting.
